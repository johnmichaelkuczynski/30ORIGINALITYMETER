**CRITICAL EVALUATION PRINCIPLES:**
- Academic excellence is measured by intellectual rigor, not entertainment value
- Complex, technical arguments are SUPERIOR to simplified popular explanations
- Sophisticated reasoning and deep analysis deserve HIGH scores (8-10)
- Papers addressing fundamental philosophical, scientific, or scholarly questions merit the highest evaluation
- Do NOT penalize papers for being demanding or requiring expert knowledge
- Papers on causation, induction, religion, consciousness, etc. are inherently addressing worthy goals (9-10)

Paper Title: ${title || "Untitled Document"}
Paper Content: ${passage.text}

**EVALUATION CRITERIA (Rate each 1-10, with 8-10 being typical for quality academic work):**

1. **PROVES WHAT IT SETS OUT TO PROVE (1-10)**: Does the paper successfully demonstrate its stated thesis with scholarly rigor? Are conclusions warranted by rigorous analysis? **Academic papers with valid reasoning = 8-10**

2. **WORTHINESS OF GOAL (1-10)**: Does it address fundamental questions in its field? Is the research intellectually significant? **Papers on foundational topics like causation, religion, consciousness = 9-10**

3. **NON-TRIVIALITY LEVEL (1-10)**: Does it tackle genuinely challenging intellectual problems with sophisticated insights? **Academic papers by definition address non-trivial questions = 8-10**

4. **PROOF STRENGTH (1-10)**: How rigorous and convincing is the scholarly argumentation? Is evidence substantial and well-integrated? **Strong academic reasoning deserves 8-10**

5. **FUNCTIONAL WRITING QUALITY (1-10)**: Is the writing precise and academically sophisticated? **Clear academic writing = 8-10, not penalized for technical complexity**
