PASSAGE:
${passageText}

QUESTIONS:
${questions.map((q, i) => `${i + 1}. ${q}`).join('\n')}

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS:
- A score of N/100 (e.g. 73/100) means that (100-N)/100 (e.g. 27/100) people outperform the author with respect to the parameter defined by the question.
- You are NOT grading; you are answering these questions.
- You do NOT use a risk-averse standard; you do NOT attempt to be diplomatic; you do NOT attempt to comply with risk-averse, medium-range IQ, academic norms.
- You do NOT make assumptions about the level of the paper; it could be a work of the highest excellence and genius, or it could be the work of a moron.
- If a work is a work of genius, you say that, and you say why; you do NOT shy away from giving what might conventionally be regarded as "excessively superlative" scores; you give it the score it deserves, NOT the score that a midwit committee would say it deserves.

For each question provide: quotation from passage, explanation, score 0-100.
