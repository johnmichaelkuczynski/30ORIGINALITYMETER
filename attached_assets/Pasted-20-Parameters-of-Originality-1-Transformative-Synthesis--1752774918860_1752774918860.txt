20 Parameters of Originality
________________________________________
1. Transformative Synthesis
•	Question: Does the author combine existing ideas to generate a new framework or insight?
•	High: Juxtaposes ideas in a way that yields explanatory surplus or resolves a tension.
•	Low: Glues together unrelated points without new structure or insight.
________________________________________
2. Constraint-Respecting Deformation
•	Question: Has the author bent or stretched a known theory without breaking internal coherence?
•	High: Adjusts a known model creatively while keeping its logic or evidence intact.
•	Low: Mutates concepts randomly, breaking the internal rules of the tradition it draws from.
________________________________________
3. Epistemic Reframing
•	Question: Does the author recast a known issue in a way that redefines how it’s understood?
•	High: Shifts the angle of approach, producing a reorientation of the debate.
•	Low: Repeats existing framings with cosmetic changes or stale analogies.
________________________________________
4. Historical Rarity
•	Question: Would the author’s moves have been surprising or rare at the time they were written?
•	High: Uses moves that are not found in typical archives or literature of the period.
•	Low: Follows predictable or heavily worked-over patterns.
________________________________________
5. Recursive Innovation
•	Question: Does the concept or argument generate more versions of itself in different settings?
•	High: Scales across levels or invites reuse and extension.
•	Low: Stays fixed; can’t be reapplied without breaking down.
________________________________________
6. Oblique Solution Path
•	Question: Is the problem solved in an indirect but successful way?
•	High: The answer comes sideways — surprising but coherent.
•	Low: The answer is direct but trivial — or indirect and incoherent.
________________________________________
7. Meta-Theoretic Awareness
•	Question: Does the author show insight about the frameworks that govern the discourse?
•	High: Challenges or revises the foundational assumptions of a field.
•	Low: Accepts disciplinary defaults without question.
________________________________________
8. Semantic Diagonalization
•	Question: Are multiple conceptual layers crossed to produce novelty?
•	High: Moves across object/meta, form/content, or logic/ethics in productive ways.
•	Low: Stays at one level; doesn’t create new cross-layer understanding.
________________________________________
9. Tool Reappropriation
•	Question: Does the author use a method or concept from one field in a powerful new domain?
•	High: Transposes ideas in a way that changes both source and target domains.
•	Low: Imports tools without adapting them or showing why they belong.
________________________________________
10. Analogical Leverage
•	Question: Are analogies used to generate insight — not just to decorate?
•	High: Core arguments depend on analogies that illuminate deeper structure.
•	Low: Analogy is decorative, shallow, or unnecessary.
________________________________________
11. Category Rupture
•	Question: Does the text challenge or destabilize a settled conceptual category?
•	High: Redefines what counts as ‘mind’, ‘meaning’, ‘truth’, etc.
•	Low: Accepts traditional categories without challenge.
________________________________________
12. Compression-Expansion Tension
•	Question: Does the author compress prior ideas while opening new ones?
•	High: Minimal setup leads to maximal generativity.
•	Low: Either too compressed (cryptic) or too bloated (inefficient).
________________________________________
13. Semantic Reconfiguration
•	Question: Are the meanings of key terms redefined in powerful ways?
•	High: Terms are altered to shift the logic of the discussion.
•	Low: Terms retain their conventional definitions.
________________________________________
14. Ontological Innovation
•	Question: Does the work introduce a new kind of thing, property, or structural level?
•	High: Adds new building blocks to the domain (e.g., new kinds of causality, value, or identity).
•	Low: Uses only familiar ontological components.
________________________________________
15. Generative Asymmetry
•	Question: Is a small move leveraged to create large conceptual ripples?
•	High: One idea triggers a cascade of consequences.
•	Low: Each move is linear and proportionate — no leverage.
________________________________________
16. Frame Violation
•	Question: Does the author knowingly break a disciplinary boundary and get away with it?
•	High: Violates norms productively, e.g., importing logic into aesthetics with real effect.
•	Low: Stays in lane, or breaks norms with no gain.
________________________________________
17. Anchor-to-Drift Ratio
•	Question: Is the text both grounded and original — not just one or the other?
•	High: References tradition but moves far beyond it.
•	Low: Either recycles the past or floats unmoored.
________________________________________
18. Unforced Nonconformity
•	Question: Does the originality seem necessary — not performative?
•	High: Divergence emerges naturally from logic or insight.
•	Low: Originality feels like branding or affectation.
________________________________________
19. Asymmetric Discourse Positioning
•	Question: Is the author’s voice distinct — not reducible to known positions?
•	High: Not a standard liberal, materialist, idealist, etc. Speaks from a new angle.
•	Low: Slot easily into known schools of thought.
________________________________________
20. Temporal Calibration
•	Question: Does the originality make sense for the time of writing?
•	High: Author anticipates future developments or marks a break with past norms.
•	Low: Move was either already obvious at the time or incoherent for that era.
