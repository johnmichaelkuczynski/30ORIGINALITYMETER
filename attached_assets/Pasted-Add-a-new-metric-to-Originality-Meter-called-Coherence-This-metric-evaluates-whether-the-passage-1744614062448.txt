Add a new metric to Originality Meter called “Coherence.”

This metric evaluates whether the passage, despite being original or semantically distant, is logically and conceptually coherent.

🔍 What Coherence Means:
The passage should:

Maintain internal consistency

Avoid contradiction or conceptual confusion

Present ideas that build logically from one another

Use terms consistently (no semantic drift mid-passage)

Be intelligible as a unified, structured argument or narrative

📊 Coherence Score Output:
Add a section alongside the existing originality metrics called “Coherence”

Include a numeric score (0–10) and short paragraph explanation

Example:

Score: 8.2/10
“The passage develops its ideas in a clear sequence, avoids contradiction, and maintains consistent use of terminology.”

🧠 How It Interacts with Originality:
Coherence must be evaluated independently from originality

If a passage has high originality but low coherence, app should flag that:

“While this passage introduces novel distinctions, it suffers from semantic fragmentation and weak logical progression.”

If both originality and coherence are high, mark as “High-Quality Original Work.”

🧾 In Evaluation Summary Section:
Add summary labels like:

“Original but incoherent”

“Conventional but coherent”

“Original and coherent” ✅

“Derivative and incoherent” ❌

🔁 Optional Follow-up Actions:
If coherence is low, add a button:

“Help Me Clarify This” — lets the user enter dialogue with AI to rewrite or restructure the passage to improve coherence

Coherence Score: 5.6/10
“The passage introduces compelling ideas, but their interrelation is underdeveloped. It transitions abruptly between arguments and uses key terms in subtly inconsistent ways.”

User clicks: “Help Me Clarify This”

AI says:

“You seem to introduce the term ‘aesthetic autonomy’ midway through without explaining how it relates to ‘formal rationality’ from earlier. Would you like help restructuring the flow?”
