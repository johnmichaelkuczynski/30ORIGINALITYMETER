
i asked the app to rewrite a 50,000 word document and it gave me a 1000 word rewrite. this is obivusly unacceptable. here is how you solve this. you use 'chunking'. first of all, when a large (more than 1000 word) document is uploaded, the app 'chunks' it, meaning that it divides it into chunks of around 500 words or so; and it the user can click on a given chunk (represented by a number) and preview it; and he can selected which ever chnks he wants. (so if is a 90 chunk document, he can select chunks 4, 15, and 28 for rewriting.) and the user can customize the instructions --ie he will give customized instructions to the app as to how to rewrite the chunks in question. whenever the user tries to rewrire more than one chunk, the app will send them to the llm sequentially, one after the other--not simultaneously. moreover, as soon as a given chunk is processed--ie as soon as the llm has rewritten it--it will show up in the output box: this is essentially, because if it si a very large rewrite, the user has to see how the rewrite is coming along so that he knows whether he should start again (and it would be absurd for him to wait four hours for a bad rewrite). moreover, there is to be a strict rule in place requiring all rewrites to be longer than the original; and this will be achieved--ie token limits will be side stepped via chunking. moreove,r the user can do more than just select which chunks to rewrite; he can also opt to expand chunks (ie to rewrite a given single chunk so that it is five chunks); and he can also opt to add chunks anywhere in the text (front, back, middle); and he can opt to do any combination of thse. all rewrites involving mathematical notation will be rendered absolutely perfectly; all texts will be downloads as word, html, txt, and pdf; and pdf download is to be done by via the print/save-as-pdf function, since this is the only way to preaserve math notation. also, in addition to word/pdf/txt uploads, the app will oct process (both text and math) images using match pix. do you understand whati am aksing?
