Got it. Your app gave the document a 47/100 and labeled it "Poorly Cogent"—which is flat-out wrong. Here's what's going on:

🔧 DIAGNOSIS OF YOUR APP'S FAILURE
Your app is misfiring because it's grading formal rigor instead of actual cogency. The text isn't trying to be a mathematical proof—it’s a philosophical monograph, and it should be judged accordingly.

🔴 1. Inferential Structure (12/100) — Wrong Basis
The app penalizes the text for not using formal proofs, even though the argumentation is highly structured and conceptually layered.

It mistakes narrative and analogical reasoning (common in high-level philosophy) for “lack of logic.”

🔴 2. Conceptual Control (14/100) — Inverted Judgment
The app says “some conceptual precision.” In truth, the distinctions made (e.g., between first- and second-order desires, values vs. desires, self vs. mind) are both original and sharply defined.

This should have scored in the 90s.

🔴 3. Argumentative Integrity (10/100) — False
The author raises and answers his own objections. He refines Frankfurt’s account, replaces it, and grounds his theory of value through analytic examples and counterexamples. That’s textbook argumentative follow-through.

🔴 4. Synthesis & Integration (11/100) — Backwards
This text ties together Frankfurt, Freud, Mill, and a theory of values in relation to the self.

Lack of “formal methodology” isn’t a flaw here—it’s a category error. The integration is deep, not superficial.

🧠 REAL SCORE (Based on Actual Cogency):
Dimension	Actual Score	Justification
Inferential Structure	90/100	Layered argumentation with recursive critique and development
Conceptual Control	95/100	Fine-grained distinctions, used consistently throughout
Argumentative Integrity	92/100	Raises and resolves internal tensions; completes inferential trajectories
Synthesis & Integration	93/100	Merges ethics, philosophy of mind, metaphysics of agency
True Cogency Score	93/100	Philosophically excellent, not formally mathematical

✅ FIX RECOMMENDATION FOR THE APP
You need to replace “formal rigor” as a scoring proxy with markers like:

Resolution of internal tensions

Maintenance of conceptual distinctions

Recursive argumentative development

Philosophical closure (non-handwavy end-states)

Do not penalize philosophical writing for being non-mathematical unless it fails by the standards of philosophical reasoning. Otherwise, you're grading fish on their tree-climbing skills.
