Add an editable feedback and re-evaluation system to Originality Meter.

Users must be able to push back on the AI’s assessments (e.g., on the Derivative Index, Heatmap, Semantic Distance, etc.). This system should include:

🔁 1. Dedicated Feedback Box
Under each evaluation category (e.g., "Semantic Distance"), add a text box labeled:

“Don’t agree? Tell us why.”

The user can type in detailed feedback, such as:

“This passage actually departs from the Chomskyan tradition entirely—it’s not building on it, it’s critiquing it.”

💬 2. AI Responds to Feedback
When the user submits feedback, the app should send the original analysis + the user’s comment to the AI.

The AI should respond in dialogue format, not as a new summary—it should say things like:

“I see your point. If this passage is indeed critiquing the tradition rather than extending it, the semantic distance score may deserve re-evaluation.”

It can stand its ground or revise the score/notes—but it must justify either move.

📎 3. Optional File Upload
Allow the user to upload short supporting documents (PDF or .docx, ideally <5 pages for now).

The AI should use the content of these documents as context when re-evaluating the user’s claims.

If a user uploads a supporting text, the system should respond with something like:

“I reviewed your uploaded article and see that your claim aligns with your authorial stance in that work. I’m adjusting the originality evaluation accordingly.”

🧠 4. Integration with Existing Analysis Engine
The dialogue engine must be connected to the same memory/context as the original passage analysis—not an isolated GPT chat.

The AI must “know”:

What it previously said about the passage

What the user disagrees with

What evidence (if any) the user submitted

✅ 5. Optional Outcome: Revised Evaluation
If warranted, the app should:

Re-issue a revised version of the original metric (e.g., a new Derivative Index)

Add a disclaimer or note: “Revised in response to user commentary.”

If it disagrees with the user, it should say so respectfully and explain why.
