1.0 Is linguistic meaning a strictly psychological notion?
In Naming and Necessity, Kripke decisively showed that proper names are not definite descriptions. In doing this, Kripke was making a specific point concerning the semantics of a specific class of expressions. It might therefore seem that what Kripke was doing in NN, though non-trivial, was too narrow to be of great philosophical importance.
But implicit in what Kripke said about proper names are many deep and important principles concerning the very nature of meaning and the relationship between language and thought. In 1975, Hilary Putnam published an article titled The meaning of “meaning” (henceforth, “MM”) in which he explicitly stated one of these principles and cogently argued for it. What he showed is that what we think does not, by itself, establish what our words and sentences mean.
It’s obvious that what we think largely determines what it is that our expressions mean. The word “snow” could refer to anything; it would be easy to create a language in which it referred, not to so snow, but to Julius Caesar. (Let’s create such a language right now. Let L be a language that is just like English except that, in L, “snow” refers to Julius Caesar and “Julius Caesar” refers to snow. L is a perfectly good language—it’s as expressively powerful a language as English.) It’s obviously at least partly because of what some people were thinking at certain times that “snow” refers to snow, and not to Julius Caesar.
But Putnam made it clear that there is an important non-psychological dimension to linguistic meaning. Given only that, at any given moment, person X is psychologically and behaviorally indistinguishable from person Y, it does not follow that the words leaving X’s mouth have the same meanings as the words leaving Y’s mouth. So, supposing that at any given moment X is having a given thought if and only if Y is having an exactly similar thought, and that X is producing a given utterance if and only if Y is producing an exactly similar utterance, it does not follow that what is meant by X’s utterance coincides with what is meant by Y’s. Even though the psychological state that gave rise to the one utterance is just like the psychological state that gave rise to the other, the meaning of the one may diverge from that of the other.
1.1 Putnam’s argument
Let Twin-Earth be a planet in some distant galaxy that satisfies the following conditions. Given any person x on Earth, there is a person y on Twin-Earth who is an atom-for-atom duplicate of x. At any given moment, y has a given thought if and only if x has that thought; y has a given feeling if and only if x has that very feeling. y acts a certain way if and only if x acts in an exactly similar way; y makes a certain noise if and only if x makes an exactly similar noise. Thus, Earth people are psychologically and behaviorally exactly like Twin-Earth people. They think, feel, do, and say the very same things at the very same times.
It is merely coincidence that Earth people are in lock-step with Twin-Earth people. There is no causal interaction between Earth people and Twin-Earth people. No messages are sent from one planet to the other; nobody on either planet in any way influences anyone on the other.
Even though Earth and Twin-Earth are extremely similar, there is an important difference between them. On Twin-Earth, the liquid in bathtubs, drinking glasses, lakes, etc., isn’t H2O—it’s XYZ. (“XYZ” is an abbreviation for some long chemical formula.) With that qualification, Twin-Earth is, at any given moment, exactly like Earth.
 
Let’s continue our story. Smith is a psychologically normal, English speaking, adult Earthling who lives in the 1600s. One day, after doing back-breaking work for several hours, Smith desperately wants to drink some cool water. Addressing his companion, Smith says:

(SE) “When people are thirsty, they find it more refreshing to drink cool, glacial water than warm, swamp water; and if there were no clean water, people couldn’t survive.”

This utterance takes place at time t.
Important point: SE doesn’t refer to a sentence. It refers to a specific utterance of a sentence. It refers to the specific burst of noise produced by Smith at time t. (Different people can utter a given sentence; different people can utter the sentence uttered by Smith (viz. “when people are thirsty, they find it more refreshing to drink cool, glacial water than . . .”)
Bear in mind here that, in Smith’s time, nothing was known about the chemical composition of water. People obviously had thoughts about water; they wanted to drink it; bathe in it, and so on. But they didn’t know that it was H2O; they didn’t even grasp the concepts needed to grasp the concept of an H2O molecule.
On Twin-Earth, there is somebody who, at any given moment, is psychologically and behaviorally just like Smith. (This follows from what we said earlier.) Let Twin-Smith be that person. At any given time, Twin-Smith makes the very noises as Smith and, in so doing, expresses the very sentiments. (This too follows from our earlier points.) Thus, at time t, Twin-Smith says:

(TS) “When people are thirsty, they find it more refreshing to drink cool, glacial water than warm, swamp water; and if there were no clean water, people couldn’t survive.”

Important point: TS doesn’t refer to a sentence. It refers to a specific utterance of a sentence—to the specific burst of noise produced by Twin-Smith at time t.
Question: Does SE have the same meaning as TS? I am not asking whether Smith and Twin-Smith coincide in respect of what they mean by their respective utterances, but whether SE and TS coincide in respect of what they mean. The question doesn’t concern what Smith and Twin-Smith are trying to convey through their respective utterances; it concerns what those utterances themselves mean.
SE and TS don’t have the same meaning. They have different propositions for their respective meanings, and the one proposition is true in circumstances where the other is false, and false in circumstances where the other is true.
“Water” refers to the substance whose chemical composition is H2O. That’s a simple fact. A thoroughly competent speaker of English can easily fail to know that “water” refers to that substance. Newton didn’t know it, even though he was an exceptionally intelligent person who spoke perfect English. But that doesn’t matter. Here on Earth, there is a certain liquid x such that x is found in bathtubs, drinking glasses, lakes, and oceans, and such that that is referred to as “water.” That substance was referred to as “water” for many hundreds of years before anything was known about chemistry or, in particular, about the chemical composition of that substance. When, finally, that substance was analyzed, it turned out to consist of H2O molecules. Thus,

(WAT1) “there is some substance x such that x is found in bathtubs, drinking glasses, lakes, and oceans, and such that x consists of H2O molecules, and such that: ‘water’ refers to x.”

Of course, we now know that the substance referred to as “water” is H2O. And if we were to discover some substance that consisted of XYZ, not H2O, but was otherwise just like water, at least as far as the conditions that are likely to obtain on the surface of the Earth are concerned, that other substance wouldn’t be H2O. The chemists who discovered XYZ would not come to the conclusion that water is sometimes H2O and is sometimes XYZ. No—they’d say that water is always H2O, but that a different substance, namely XYZ, is extremely water-like, at least within certain horizons.
When they weren’t referring to XYZ by its chemical name, chemists would not refer to it as “water.” Maybe they’d refer to it as “pseudo-water” or as “fool’s water”—but not “water.” This practice of theirs wouldn’t be a
 
case of hair-splitting pedantry. If chemists did refer to this other substance as “water,” their doing so would violate beliefs that are deeply embedded in common sense. Even the most philistine, intellectually narrow human being desperately wants real diamonds, not zirconium imitation diamonds, and thus knows that being diamond-like isn’t the same thing as being a diamond. Similarly, everybody knows that being water-like isn’t the same thing as being real water. And even if some people don’t know it, they’d quickly learn it, no matter how scientifically uninformed they were, if the distinction between water and XYZ became a financially significant one, like the distinction between diamonds and chunks of zirconium paste that resemble diamonds.
For the same reasons mutatis mutandis, on Twin-Earth “water” would refer to XYZ, not H2O. And it would always have referred to XYZ—even before scientists on their planet discovered its chemical composition.
Before proceeding, let’s deal with an objection that is likely to be heard:

An English-speaking physical chemist obviously knows a lot about water that other English speakers don’t . But what the physical chemist knows that other English speakers don’t has nothing to do with the English language or, therefore, with semantics. Given only that somebody doesn’t have a PhD in physical chemistry, it doesn’t follow that they have any linguistic deficits—that they don’t really know the identities of the semantic rules governing expressions like “water,” “gold,” “lead,” etc. This is all quite uncontroversial.
But it’s inconsistent with the view you (speaking on Putnam’s behalf) are advocating. You say that, for something to be water, it isn’t enough that it have certain macro-characteristics: it must have a specific chemical composition—it must be H2O. Given that, as a matter of semantics, “water” refers to water, what you’re saying entails that, as a matter of semantics, “water” refers to H2O. But if that were right, one couldn’t master the English language without knowing the chemical composition of water or, by obvious extensions of this argument, the chemical composition of gold or aluminum. But that’s preposterous.

One doesn’t have to know anything about chemistry to have a complete mastery of English (or any other natural language), and it would be preposterous to deny that. But the view I’m describing doesn’t have that consequence. There is some individual x such that the semantic rule for the expression “Barack Obama” is to the effect that:

(BO) “Barack Obama refers to x.”

BO pairs off a name with an individual. If one doesn’t know which individual that is, then one doesn’t know the semantic rule for “Barack Obama” and, therefore, one doesn’t know all of the semantic rules constitutive of the English language in 2009.
But there are infinitely many ways of singling out any given entity. This is a consequence of the fact that, as a matter of logic, any given object uniquely satisfies infinitely many different descriptions. Let P be the region of space you were occupying the instant you began reading this sentence, and let t be that instant. You uniquely satisfy each of the following predicates: “thing that occupied p one minute before time t + one minute,” “thing that occupied p two minutes before time t + two minutes,” and so on. We’ll henceforth abbreviate the first of these predicates as “P1,” the second as “P2,” etc.
For argument’s sake, let’s suppose that your name is “Jack Jones.” There is some x such that x uniquely satisfies each of P1, P2, P3, etc., and such that, in order to the know semantic rule governing that expression, one must know that:

(JJ) “Jack Jones refers to x.”

If Smith knows that:

(JJ75) there is some x such that x uniquely satisfies P75 and such that: “Jack Jones” refers to x
 
and Jones knows that:

(JJ143) there is some x such that x uniquely satisfies P143 and such that: “Jack Jones” refers to x

Smith and Jones are, to that extent, in complete semantic accord. There is some one x such that x satisfies each of P75 and P143, and such that, given any property psi, when Smith says:

(JJ1) ‹Jack Jones has psi›

he is affirming that

(JJ2) x has psi,

and such that when Jones utters JJ1, he too is affirming that x has psi. Further, it is each individual’s intention in uttering JJ1 to affirm JJ2. What each wishes to do is to attribute psi to some person—nothing more. Neither wants to say anything about his way of thinking about that person. Neither wishes to say of P75 or P143 or any other property that it is uniquely instantiated or that all its instances are psis.
Points exactly similar to those just made about “Jack Jones” hold with respect to “water.” At time t, bathtub B is filled with pure water, on which your rubber ducky is floating. Your mother points to that B and says:

(*) The liquid in the tub is known as “water.”

A few days later, at time t*, you burn your finger in scalding water. Given that water is H2O, it follows that each of the following statements is true:

(1) there is some liquid x such that, at time t, x is what your rubber ducky is floating on; moreover, “water” refers to x.
(2) there is some liquid x such that, at time t, x is what your bathtub is full of; moreover, “water” refers to x. (3) there is some liquid x such that x and x alone is H2O, and such that “water” refers to x.
(4) there is some liquid x such that, at time t*, x and x alone is what scalded your finger; moreover, “water” refers to x.
(5) there is some liquid x such that x and x alone is H2O and such that, at time t*, x and x alone is what scalded your finger; moreover, “water” refers to x.

And so on.
To know what “water” refers to, it is necessary only that you know some truth of the form:

(n) there is some substance x such that x uniquely has property phi; “water” refers to x.

Since water uniquely has each of infinitely many different properties, n is true for each of infinitely many values of phi. Where any given one of these truths is concerned, knowing it is sufficient, but not necessary, for knowing what “water” refers to and, therefore, for knowing the semantics of that expression.
Since n is a sentence-schema, not a sentence proper, it does not itself express any one of these truths. But in what follows, take n to stand for an arbitrary one of them.
Only the italicized part of n describes a semantic rule. The rest describes the information through which one grasps that rule. Anyone who knows the semantics of water knows this (though they might not recognize what it is that they know in the statements just made).
Let’s tell another story about Smith and Jones. Both are competent speakers of English. Smith knows that:

(7) there is some liquid x such that x is what is in bathtubs and drinking glasses; moreover, “water” refers to x.
 
Jones, who is more scientifically minded than Smith, knows that:

(8) there is some liquid x such that x is H2O and such that creatures with gills can breathe when immersed in x and creatures with lungs cannot; moreover, “water” refers to x.

There is some liquid x such that individual’s sole intention in saying

(w2) “water covers most of the Earth’s surface”

is to say:

(w3) x covers most of the Earth’s surface.

Neither wishes to affirm either that:

(w4) there is some liquid x such that x is what is in bathtubs and drinking glasses, and such that “water” refers to x; moreover, x covers most of the Earth’s surface,

or that

(w5) there is some liquid x such that x is H2O and such that creatures with gills can breathe when immersed in x and creatures with lungs cannot; moreover, x covers most of the Earth’s surface.

Each individual’s intention in uttering w2 is to ascribe a certain property to a certain substance. They have the same substance in mind. They wish to attribute the same property to it. Neither wants to say anything about how he thinks about that substance. Neither wants to attribute any property to anything other than that substance. Thus, what Smith means when he says “water covers most of the Earth’s surface” is exactly what Jones means when he utters the same sentence. And so long as each knows that the other agrees with him about what it is that “water” that refers to, any difference between them in respect of how they think about its referent will in no way jeopardize the one person’s ability to understand the other. To put it more formally: provided that, for some x, each believes that “water” refers to x and that each knows that the other believes this, the differences between these two individuals in respect of how they think about that substance won’t jeopardize their ability to communicate with each other.
1.2 Putnam’s semantic externalism (continued)
These points make it clear why it is that Smith and Twin-Smith, though driven to make the very same noises by the very same internal conditions, are nonetheless affirming different propositions. Let’s suppose that when Smith was a child, his mother pointed to the liquid in the tub in which Smith regularly bathed, and which Smith recognized as the liquid that he had to drink in order to live, and said: “That is water.” The message that is communicated to Smith is along the lines of:

(8) There is some liquid x such that x is what I (Smith) bathe in and must also drink in order to survive and “water” refers to x.

Given that the liquid indicated by Smith’s mother is, of its very nature, H2O, it follows that when, at time t, Smith utters SE, his utterance is true exactly if:

(SE*) “When people are thirsty, they find it more refreshing to drink cool, glacial H2O than warm, swamp H2O; and if there were no clean H2O, people couldn’t survive.
 
Because he lives hundreds of years before the birth of modern chemistry known, Smith has no idea what it would even mean to identify water with H2O. Moreover, nobody who is alive at the time has any such idea. Nonetheless, the statement he is making does concern H2O. This shows that:

(PTM) the meanings borne by our utterances are not determined solely by the thoughts we have; there is a strictly non-psychological, strictly environmental dimension to linguistic meaning.

Given what we know about Twin-Smith and Twin-Earth, it follows that, when Twin-Smith utters TS, what he is saying is true exactly if:

(TS*) “When people are thirsty, they find it more refreshing to drink cool, glacial XYZ than warm, swamp water; and if there were no clean XYZ, people couldn’t survive.”

And this is obviously consistent with Putnam’s thesis (henceforth “PTM”).
The doctrine that PTM is true is known as semantic externalism. It is so-called because, according to PTM, the determinants of the semantics of our expressions are (in some cases, in some respects) external to us.
2.0 Burge’s blunder—the (mis)step from semantic to content externalism
PTM is a deep, important, and original insight, and Putnam deserves sole credit for it. And unlike many of the philosophers who were influenced by his important article, Putnam’s views as to what PTM does and does not imply were correct. In MM, Putnam says that Smith’s words don’t have quite the same meanings as Twin-Smith’s words, even though Smith and Twin-Smith have the same thoughts.
Under pressure from other philosophers, especially Tyler Burge, Putnam later rejected this correct and profound insight, and he came to accept Burge’s position, which is that, not only do Smith’s words have different meanings from Twin-Smith’s, Smith’s thoughts don’t have the same contents as Twin-Smith’s.
Burge’s work has been enormously influential. It didn’t just influence Putnam, but analytic philosophy as a whole. Thanks largely to Burge’s work, it came to be widely held for 20 years or so that Smith and Twin-Smith have different thoughts. This must be understood aright. Nobody denies that Smith and Twin-Smith have numerically different thoughts. Burge is making the much less innocuous claim that what Smith is thinking is different from what Twin-Smith is thinking. In Burge’s view, just my thought that it’s hot during the summer has a different content from your thought that it’s cold during the winter, so, according to Burge, the thought that Smith expresses in saying, for property psi, “water has psi” is different from the thought that Twin-Smith expresses by means of that same utterance.
This interesting chapter in the history of analytic philosophy began in 1979, four years after Putnam published MM, with the publication of Burge’s article “Individualism and the mental” (henceforth, “BI”). Here is what Burge argues. There is a planet, which we’ll call “Twin-Earth,” that is exactly like Earth, with one qualification to be stated in a moment. The events on Twin-Earth are in lockstep with those on Earth. So given that earthling Smith sneezes at a certain time, Twin-earthling Twin-Smith sneezes in the exact same way at the exact same time.
Given what we’ve said, it follows that English is spoken by many people on Twin-Earth. Twin-Smith is one of these people. On our planet—on Earth, in other words—“arthritis” refers to a disease exclusively of the joints. On Twin-Earth, “arthritis” refers to a malady not only of the joints, but also of certain bones (as opposed to the cartilaginous joints linking bones to one another). So, on Twin-Earth, “arthritis” doesn’t refer to the same disease that it refers to on Earth. It refers to a similar, but distinct ailment. Let us refer to that ailment as “twin-arthritis.”
On Earth, Smith regards the sentence:

(AU) “arthritis is unpleasant”
 
as expressing a truth. And because he personally suffers from arthritis, he often utters AU. (In this context, it is to be assumed that Smith is speaking sincerely, is cognitively competent, etc., and these same assumptions are to be made about Twin-Smith).
Like Smith, Twin-Smith regards AU as expressing a truth. But, according to Burge, the thought underlying Twin-Smith’s utterance of AU is different from the thought underlying Smith’s utterance of it. Twin-Smith is thinking about twin-arthritis, not arthritis, and Smith is thinking about arthritis, not twin-arthritis. In a moment, we’ll evaluate this important claim.
Burge concludes from this that two people who are atom-for-atom duplicates of each other, each a perfect physiological and psychological clone of the other, may have thoughts with different contents. Twin-Smith is thinking Descartes (or Twin-Descartes, rather) was a great philosopher, whereas Smith is thinking Ted Danson is a great philosopher, notwithstanding that Smith and Twin-Smith are, by Burge’s hypothesis, psychologically exactly the same.
Is Burge right? First of all, he’s right that, on Twin-Earth, “arthritis” doesn’t refer to arthritis, and instead refers to twin-arthritis. This is precisely what Putnam showed. But is Burge right that Smith and Twin-Smith are cognitively different?
No. How does Smith learn what “arthritis” refers to? Here’s a possible answer (and it’s representative, in the relevant respects, of all the other possible answers). Addressing Smith, so and so says:

(A1) “the unpleasant inflammation in your knees is due to arthritis; arthritis can do terrible damage to one’s joints.”

A1 is to the effect that:

(A2) there is some x such that the swelling in your knees is due to x and such that x can do terrible damage to one’s joints; moreover, “arthritis” refers to x.

For now familiar reasons, it follows that when Smith hears someone say:

(A3) “arthritis has psi,”

the message that is communicated (not literally meant) is:

(A4) There is some x such that the swelling in your knees is due to x, such that x can do terrible damage to one’s joints, and such that “arthritis” refers to x; moreover, “arthritis” refers to x.

Remember that Twin-Smith’s life precisely parallels Smith’s. It therefore follows that, when Twin-Smith hears someone utter (A3), is the message that is communicated (not literally meant) is (A4).
Thus, contrary to what Burge says, Smith’s thoughts do have the same content as Twin-Smith’s. It’s true that, for the reasons given by Putnam, the sentences they use to express those thoughts don’t always have the same literal meanings. But unless one countenances the obviously false assumption that what we think coincides exactly with what our expressions mean, it doesn’t follow that Smith’s thoughts have the same contents as Twin-Smith’s .

In this dissertation, I critically examine the philosophy of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism is, among other things, a philosophy of mental content. It attempts to dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental content by splitting the difference between two diametrically opposed accounts of content. John McDowell's minimal empiricism and Richard Gaskin's minimalist empiricism are two versions of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism itself originates with McDowell's work. This dissertation is divided into five parts. First, in the Introduction, I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined. Second, I offer a detailed description of McDowell’s minimal empiricism. Third, I critique Gaskin's critique and modification of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that (1) Gaskin's critiques are faulty and that (2) Gaskin's minimalist empiricism is very dubious. Fourth, I scrutinize the alleged credentials of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that McDowell's version of linguistic idealism is problematic. I then comment on a recent dialogue between transcendental empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology. The dialogue culminates with Dreyfus's accusation of the “Myth of the Mental.” I argue that this accusation is correct in which case McDowell's direct realism is problematic. I conclude that minimal empiricism does not dissolve the dilemma of mental content. Finally, I argue that Tyler Burge successfully undermines the doctrine of disjunctivism, but disjunctivism is crucial for transcendental empiricism. Ultimately, however, I aim to show that transcendental empiricism is an attractive alternative to philosophies of mental content.

Original definition-making

“Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation… provides a plateau…”
Not a definition — metaphor instead of precision.

Precision of terms
“Minimal empiricism,” “minimalist empiricism,” “transcendental empiricism” all float without anchoring.
Score: 50/100

Distinction-tracking

Score: 55/100

Avoidance of tautology
Mostly avoids tautologies — but replaces them with vague filler.
Score: 65/100

Avoidance of empty generality

“Transcendental empiricism is, among other things, a philosophy of mental content.”
That could be said of dozens of views; empty.
Score: 50/100

Compression of examples into principle
No examples at all, so no compression possible.
Score: 40/100

Ability to invert perspective
Doesn’t challenge its own framing; just stacks critiques.

Anticipation of objections
Mentions critics (Gaskin, Dreyfus, Burge) but doesn’t actually work through their force.
Score: 60/100

Elimination of redundancy

“This dissertation is divided into five parts. First… Second… Third…”
Merely itinerary; repeats structure without deepening content.
Score: 50/100

Conceptual economy (no waste concepts)
Piles terms — “minimal empiricism,” “minimalist empiricism,” “transcendental empiricism” — with little payoff.
Score: 48/100

Epistemic risk-taking (sticking neck out)
Mostly hedged or report-like. The strongest claim is:

“I argue that McDowell’s version of linguistic idealism is problematic.”
Safe, not bold.
Score: 55/100

Generativity (producing new questions/angles)

Score: 42/100

Managing complexity without collapse
Text collapses under jargon: “minimal vs. minimalist empiricism” remains unclear.
Score: 47/100

Intelligence Metrics 31–40

Detecting paradox or tension
Does not highlight paradox; contradiction in stance is unacknowledged (disavows McDowell/Gaskin yet endorses transcendental empiricism).
Score: 55/100

Apt compression into aphorism
No aphoristic turns; everything is padded.
Score: 40/100

Clarity under pressure
Dense sentences obscure the argument:

“This metaphilosophical approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined.”
Meaningless under stress.
Score: 45/100

Distinguishing levels (fact vs. meta-level)
Confuses metaphilosophy vs. substantive philosophy — Wittgenstein invoked, but how it constrains argument is not explained.
Score: 52/100

Relating concrete to abstract seamlessly
No concretes — purely abstract.
Score: 38/100

Control of scope (not sprawling aimlessly)
Scope lurches — from McDowell to Dreyfus to Burge, with no strong integration.
Score: 50/100

Detecting pseudo-intelligence
Falls prey to pseudo-intelligence: labels stand in for arguments.
Score: 42/100

Balancing simplicity with depth
Neither simple nor deep — verbose and shallow.
Score: 45/100

Strategic omission (knowing what not to say)
Instead of omitting clutter, the text packs in names and itinerary.
Score: 40/100

Transferability (insight applies beyond the case)
No insights generalized; all claims are name-specific (McDowell, Gaskin).

Logical validity
Claims are mostly verdicts without premises (“I argue McDowell’s linguistic idealism is problematic”). No inferential steps shown.
Score: 45/100

Absence of contradictions
Contradiction: dismisses McDowell and Gaskin yet concludes transcendental empiricism is “attractive.”
Score: 40/100

Strength of evidence/reasons
Evidence = name-checks only. No arguments presented.
Score: 38/100

Proportionality (conclusion matches support)
Conclusion is grander than the support. “Attractive alternative” unsupported.

Avoiding non sequiturs
Leaps: “Gaskin is faulty, McDowell is problematic… therefore transcendental empiricism is attractive.”
Score: 40/100

Explicit structure (clear argument shape)

Focus (avoiding drift)
Drifts through thinkers (Wittgenstein → McDowell → Gaskin → Dreyfus → Burge) with little coherence.
Score: 45/100

Inferential tightness
Loose; leaps from name to name with no bridges.

Avoiding overgeneralization
“Transcendental empiricism is an attractive alternative” is an overgeneralization without nuance.
Score: 42/100

Avoiding straw man reasoning

Hierarchy of reasons (primary vs. secondary)
No hierarchy visible — just a sequence of “I argue” statements.

Score: 42/100

Correct use of examples
Zero examples offered. Purely name-based critique.
Score: 35/100

Avoidance of loaded language
Tone is mostly neutral (“dubious,” “problematic”) but occasionally dismissive without substance.
Score: 55/100

Clear priority of claims
Order is itinerary-based, not logical-priority-based.
Score: 45/100

Avoiding category mistakes
No glaring metaphysical blunders, but “transcendental empiricism originates with McDowell” risks a category mistake (since Deleuze coined the phrase).
Score: 50/100

Explicitness of assumptions
“The dilemma of mental content” invoked but never spelled out. Hidden assumptions everywhere.
Score: 40/100

Non-redundancy in support
Repetition in structure (“I argue… I argue…”) without new substance.
Score: 45/100

Alignment between thesis and support
Support undermines the thesis (McDowell/Gaskin both problematic, yet the genus is “attractive”). Misaligned.

Clarity of logical connectives
Logical glue is absent — mostly “I argue that…” with no “therefore/because.”
Score: 38/100

Preservation of distinctions across argument
Blurs levels: metaphilosophy, epistemology, semantics all mashed without care.
Score: 42/100

Avoidance of irrelevant material
No irrelevant asides, but this is because it’s too skeletal — not because of discipline.

Stability under reformulation (holds when restated)
Rephrasing reveals contradictions (e.g., “McDowell fails, Gaskin fails, therefore transcendental empiricism succeeds”).
