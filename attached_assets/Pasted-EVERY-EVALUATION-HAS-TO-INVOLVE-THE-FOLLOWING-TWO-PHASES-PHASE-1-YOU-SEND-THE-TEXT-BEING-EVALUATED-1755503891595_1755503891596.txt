EVERY EVALUATION HAS TO INVOLVE THE FOLLOWING TWO PHASES. PHASE 1: YOU SEND THE TEXT BEING EVALUATED AND THE RELEVANT QUESTIONS.YOU DO NOT TELL THE APP 
THAT IT IS TO DETERMINE COGENCY/INTELLIGENCE/ETC. YOU SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TEXT. YOU DON'T SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE/COGENCY/...
YOU DO NOT SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE/COGENCY/ETC BY ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU JUST SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS (AND ALSO GIVE A SCORE OUT OF 100). BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL QUALIFICATION.
AFTER YOU GIVE IT THE TEXT AND THE QUESTIONS, YOU SAY THE FOLLOWING: A SCORE OF N/100 (E.G. 73/100) MEANS THAT (100-N)/100 (E.G. 27/100) OUTPERFORM 
THE AUTHOR IN WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETER DEFINED BY THE QUESTION. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU ARE NOT GRADING; YOU ARE ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU ALSO SAY:
YOU DO NOT USE A RISK-AVERSE STANDARD; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BE DIPLOMATIC; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH RISK-AVERSE, MEDIUM-RANGE IQ, ACADEMIC NORMS. 
YOU DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF THE PAPER; IT COULD BE A WORK OF THE HIGHEST EXCELENCE AND GENIUS, OR IT COULD BE THE WORK OF A MORON.
IF A WORK IS A WORK OF GENIUS, YOU SAY THAT, AND YOU SAY WHY; YOU DO NOT SHY AWAY FROM GIVING WHAT MIGHT CONVENTIONALLY BE REGARDED AS  EXCESSIVELY "SUPERLATIVE"
SCORES; YOU GIVE IT THE SCORE IT DESERVES, NOT THE SCORE THAT A MIDWIT COMMITTEE WOULD SAY IT DESERVES. PHASE 2: IF THE SCORES 
ARE LESS THAN 95/100, YOU PUSH BACK. YOU SAY: YOUR POSITION IS THAT 
(E.G.) 11/100 OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THE COGNITIVE METRIC DEFINED BY THE 
QUESTION: THAT IS YOUR POSITION, AM I RIGHT? AND ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? IN GENERAL, IF THE SCORE IS N/100 (E.G. 80/100) FOR A GIVEN QUESTION, 
YOU SAY: YOUR POSITION IS THAT 
(N-100)/100 (E.G. 20/100) OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THE COGNITIVE METRIC DEFINED BY THE 
QUESTION: THAT IS YOUR POSITION, AM I RIGHT? AND ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?" IN SAYING THIS, YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY TELLING IT TO CHANGE ITS SCORE, ONLY 
TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER IT.
