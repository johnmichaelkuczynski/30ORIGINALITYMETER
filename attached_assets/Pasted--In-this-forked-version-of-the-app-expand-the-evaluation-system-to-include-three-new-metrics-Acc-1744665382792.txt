✅ In this forked version of the app, expand the evaluation system to include three new metrics:

Accuracy – Factual and inferential correctness

Depth – Non-triviality and conceptual insight

Clarity – Readability, transparency, and semantic accessibility

These should be added alongside Originality and Coherence to form a broader intellectual quality analysis.

🔧 STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT
🔹 1. Add Three New Scoring Panels
Each should mimic the existing format (numerical score, filled visual bar, micro-justification).

Metric	Description
Accuracy	Does the passage contain factual correctness and valid inference structures?
Depth	Does the passage go beneath surface-level observations to reveal conceptual richness?
Clarity	Is the writing accessible, precise, and intelligible to its intended audience?
Each should have:

A heading (e.g., “Accuracy Score”)

A 0–10 score bar

A short paragraph of explanation

Color-coded bar (red → yellow → green) as in Originality/Coherence

🔹 2. Update Composite Score Logic
Rename to: “Total Quality Score”

Add tooltip:

"This score aggregates originality, coherence, accuracy, depth, and clarity. Coherence and depth are weighted slightly higher by default."

Suggested default weights (can be refined later):

Originality: 20%

Coherence: 20%

Accuracy: 15%

Depth: 25%

Clarity: 20%

🔹 3. Add a New Tab or Section: “Expanded Evaluation”
This tab shows all five metrics together in a visual grid or stacked layout.

Let user collapse/expand the detailed justifications.

🧠 Optional: Tooltip Texts for Each Metric
✅ Accuracy
“Evaluates whether claims made are factually supportable and whether the logic connecting them is valid. Penalizes misrepresentation, unsupported inference, or conceptual confusion.”

✅ Depth
“Measures how much conceptual work the passage does. High depth passages identify meaningful structures, expose assumptions, or reframe problems in significant ways.”

✅ Clarity
“Assesses how intelligible the passage is to its intended reader. Looks for clean sentence structure, stable terminology, and coherent expression of ideas.”

🛠️ Bonus (if feasible): Add Configurable Weights
Allow advanced users to adjust the weighting of each metric in the composite score via a slider or dropdown ("philosopher mode," "editorial mode," etc.)

🔚 Summary of Changes
✅ Add three new metrics (Accuracy, Depth, Clarity)

✅ Display scores + colored bars + explanations

✅ Recalculate and relabel “Composite” score as “Total Quality Score”

✅ Allow all five metrics to be viewed in a single interface

✅ (Optional) Let power users configure weightings
