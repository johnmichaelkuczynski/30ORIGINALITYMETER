Replit Instruction to Improve Text (Precise, Intellectual Output)

Objective: The goal is to enhance the original text’s intellectual depth, originality, and clarity without diluting its meaning or introducing unnecessary verbosity. Replit should avoid "bloggy" language or stylistic flourishes and focus on adding substance and clear examples, staying true to the core message of the passage.

Avoid Over-Elaboration: The app should keep the rewritten passage grounded in the original intellectual argument, not adding long, drawn-out metaphors or overly abstract terms.

Maintain Precision: Ensure the passage stays focused on the analysis of Moore's paradox and the solution, without straying into vague, high-level rhetoric.

Enhance Clarity: Introduce subtle modifications to improve conceptual clarity or originality, but do not overcomplicate the argument. Focus on enhancing the intellectual engagement rather than adding decorative language.

Emphasize Originality in Context: Instead of making the passage sound "novel" through flowery language, aim to make it more original by exploring additional examples, applications, or extensions of the ideas discussed.

Retain Tone and Style: The writing should be formal and intellectual but not excessively verbose. Focus on clarity, depth, and precision.

Example (Revised Text):

Original Passage:

A conceptual analysis is given by a true, non-trivial and non-empirical proposition of the form x is a phi if and only if x is a psi, for example, ‘x is a circle if and only if x is a closed planar figure of uniform curvature.’ According to G.E. Moore, there is a ‘paradox of analysis,' for the reason that if a conceptual analysis is true, then both sides of the ‘if and only if' say the same thing, in which case said analysis is uninformative. So according to Moore, ‘x is a circle if and only if x is a closed planar figure of uniform curvature' is true only if ‘x is a circle' says the same thing as ‘x is a closed planar figure of uniform curvature'; but if they both say the same thing, Moore also holds, then ‘x is a circle if and only if x is a closed planar figure of uniform curvature' is uninformative.
The solution is that the information-load borne by a statement is a function not only of what it says but how it says it. If I tell you that x is a closed planar figure of uniform curvature, the property that I am ascribing to x is the same as the property I’m ascribing to it if I say that x is a circle. But since the one ascription involves different concepts from the other and since in each case you must work through the concepts involved in the property-ascription to identify the property in question, the information borne by the one statement will differ from that borne by the other.

Refined Version:

A conceptual analysis presents a proposition of the form "x is a phi if and only if x is a psi." For instance, "x is a circle if and only if x is a closed planar figure of uniform curvature." According to G.E. Moore, this type of analysis results in a paradox: if the analysis is true, then both sides of the statement express the same content, rendering it uninformative. Moore argues that "x is a circle if and only if x is a closed planar figure of uniform curvature" is only valid if both sides are equivalent in meaning, but if they are, the analysis provides no new information.

The solution to Moore’s paradox lies in understanding that the information-load of a statement depends not only on the content it conveys but on how it is conveyed. The properties ascribed by the terms "circle" and "closed planar figure of uniform curvature" may be identical in substance, but they draw upon different conceptual frameworks. The act of describing x as a "circle" or as a "closed planar figure of uniform curvature" involves navigating distinct conceptual paths to reach the same conclusion. Therefore, the information carried by each phrase differs, despite their equivalence in meaning.

Next Steps for Replit:
Copy and paste the improved instructions above into your Replit prompt, ensuring it understands the need to focus on precision and clarity without introducing verbosity or unnecessary abstract language.

Test with the updated passage: Once Replit processes this, check if the output remains focused on intellectual rigor and directness, ensuring it avoids overly creative or "bloggy" language.
