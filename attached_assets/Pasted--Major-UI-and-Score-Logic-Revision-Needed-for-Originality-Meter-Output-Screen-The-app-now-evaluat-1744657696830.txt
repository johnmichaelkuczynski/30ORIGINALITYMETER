🚨 Major UI and Score Logic Revision Needed for Originality Meter Output Screen

The app now evaluates Originality, Coherence, and provides a Composite Score. Good. But the presentation is muddled. Here's what needs to change:

🔷 1. Split the output into three clearly labeled boxes, in this order:
✅ Box 1: Originality Comparison
Heading: “Originality Comparison”

Two sliders:

Passage A – Originality Score: 7.0/10

Passage B – Originality Score: 8.0/10

Optional: Add a brief label or badge for the winner, e.g.,

“Passage B is more original”

✅ Box 2: Coherence Comparison
Heading: “Coherence Comparison”

Two sliders:

Passage A – Coherence Score: 9.0/10

Passage B – Coherence Score: 8.0/10

Optional: Badge again:

“Passage A is more coherent”

✅ Box 3: Aggregate Evaluation
Heading: “Overall Quality Assessment”

One bar or small table that shows:

Composite Score A: 8.0

Composite Score B: 8.0

Below that, show:

“This score weights originality and coherence, with slightly more weight given to coherence.”

🧠 2. Revise the “Comparison Verdict” Panel
It should now:

Clearly justify each of the three dimensions: originality, coherence, and aggregate

Give a verdict that reflects both absolute and comparative insights

✅ Structure the text like:

Originality: Passage B explores broader conceptual terrain and reframes institutional behavior, earning a higher originality score.

Coherence: Passage A is more structurally precise and philosophically self-contained, making its ideas more digestible.

Overall: While both passages are strong, Passage A is more polished, and Passage B is more intellectually daring. Their composite scores are equal, reflecting that tradeoff.

🔁 3. Replace Ambiguous Labels
“Composite Score” → replace with:

“Passage A – Composite Score (Originality + Coherence): 8.0/10”

Remove ambiguity. Every score must clearly refer to A or B, not float free of context.

🔍 Summary:
✅ Add proper section headings
✅ Explicitly label all scores (and which passage they belong to)
✅ Break comparison into three clearly separated stages
✅ Justify every score in the verdict panel
