Metric 1
78/100
Direct Quotation:

"what a complex expression means does, after a fashion, coincide with what it is taken to mean: to the extent that speaker-performance approximates to speaker-competence"
Analysis:

The insight that linguistic meaning can be understood through the lens of competence-performance approximation applied to the divergence between compositional meaning and speaker interpretation is genuinely sophisticated. It requires seeing how Chomsky's psychological distinction can resolve a semantic puzzle about meaning-determination. This synthesis is non-obvious and demonstrates conceptual agility.

Metric 2
82/100
Direct Quotation:

"given that the meaning of such an expression is a logical consequence of the meanings of its parts, coupled with the fact that people are not infallible ratiocinators"
Analysis:

The interconnection is strikingly original - linking compositional semantics, human cognitive fallibility, and the competence/performance distinction to solve the problem of meaning-determination. This is not a standard philosophical move. The author sees a novel pathway between disparate theoretical frameworks that wouldn't naturally connect in conventional approaches.

Metric 3
75/100
Direct Quotation:

"to the extent that people are able to operationalize their linguistic competence---what speakers take complex expressions to mean coincides with they in fact mean"
Analysis:

The development moves from establishing a puzzle (divergence between compositional meaning and speaker interpretation) to proposing a graduated solution based on competence-performance approximation. This is systematic rather than merely associative, though the execution is somewhat compressed and could be more fully developed.

Metric 4
80/100
Direct Quotation:

"herein lies an answer to the question 'what is linguistic meaning?' that holds with respect to both simple and complex expressions"
Analysis:

Relative to the philosophy of language and linguistic semantics literature, this approach to the meaning-determination problem through competence/performance dynamics appears genuinely novel. The author claims to provide a unified account for both simple and complex expressions, which is ambitious and non-standard in the field.

Metric 5
73/100
Direct Quotation:

"The meaning of morpheme (a minimal unit of linguistic significance) cannot diverge from what it is taken to mean. But the meaning of a complex expression can diverge without limit"
Analysis:

This is substantively original - the author identifies a genuine asymmetry between simple and complex expressions regarding meaning-interpretation divergence, then provides a principled theoretical solution. It's not frivolous novelty but addresses a real conceptual problem with theoretical sophistication, though the solution's adequacy would require further development.

Metric 6
25/100
Direct Quotation:

"Nonetheless, given Chomsky's distinction between competence (ability) and performance (ability to deploy ability)"
Analysis:

This is decidedly not boilerplate. The theoretical move of applying Chomsky's competence/performance distinction to resolve semantic puzzles about meaning-determination is unconventional and creative. The writing style is also distinctly non-formulaic, with phrases like 'after a fashion' showing individual voice rather than academic template adherence.

Metric 7
68/100
Direct Quotation:

"what speakers take complex expressions to mean coincides with they in fact mean; and herein lies an answer to the question 'what is linguistic meaning?'"
Analysis:

An educated reader would gain genuine insight into the relationship between compositional semantics, speaker psychology, and meaning-determination. The core insight about competence/performance approximation resolving semantic puzzles is intellectually enriching. However, the compressed presentation might leave some readers needing to work harder to extract the full implications.

Metric 8
74/100
Direct Quotation:

"to the extent that speaker-performance approximates to speaker-competence---i.e. to the extent that people are able to operationalize their linguistic competence"
Analysis:

The insight that meaning-problems can be resolved through graduated approximation between idealized competence and actual performance is genuinely hard to acquire elsewhere and has broader applicability beyond linguistics - potentially illuminating other domains where ideal/actual gaps create theoretical puzzles. This represents transferable intellectual insight.

Metric 9
72/100
Direct Quotation:

"given that the meaning of such an expression is a logical consequence of the meanings of its parts, coupled with the fact that people are not infallible ratiocinators"
Analysis:

The takeaway has objective legitimacy beyond any particular theoretical system. The observation about compositional meaning, cognitive fallibility, and their interaction addresses real features of language and cognition that any adequate theory must confront. The insights don't depend on accepting particular doctrinal commitments but engage with genuine empirical and conceptual constraints.
