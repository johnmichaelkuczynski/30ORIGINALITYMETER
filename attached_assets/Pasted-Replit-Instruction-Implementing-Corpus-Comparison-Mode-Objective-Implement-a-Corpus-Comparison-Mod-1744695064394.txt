Replit Instruction: Implementing Corpus Comparison Mode
Objective: Implement a Corpus Comparison Mode that allows users to compare a specific passage (or even a full paper) to a larger body of work or the style of a known theorist. This comparison will help the user understand how their writing aligns with the intellectual rigor, tone, and style of the referenced corpus (whether it be a specific theorist, a dataset, or a general writing style).

Steps to Implement Corpus Comparison Mode:
Input Comparison Corpus:

The user will be able to upload a larger document (e.g., a full paper, a chapter, or multiple excerpts from a known theorist or a general corpus of text). This document will serve as the reference body of work for comparison.

Alternatively, the user can specify a known theorist's style (e.g., Marx, Kant, Derrida, etc.), and the app can either use pre-trained models to simulate their style or refer to an existing corpus for comparison.

Passage to Compare:

The user will input or upload a specific passage (e.g., a paragraph, a few pages, or a section of their own writing) to compare against the corpus they uploaded.

Comparison Process:

The app will process both the user's passage and the corpus and compare:

Lexical Similarity: Evaluate the word choices and phrasing.

Syntactical Structure: Analyze the sentence structure (e.g., length, complexity).

Tone/Style: Assess whether the tone of the passage matches the theorist’s style or the broader corpus (e.g., formal, academic, casual, philosophical).

Intellectual Content: Compare the concepts and frameworks used in the passage to see how well it aligns with the intellectual structure of the corpus.

Analysis Results:

The app will return results that show:

Comparison Score: A numerical score or percentage indicating the similarity between the passage and the corpus. This can be based on factors like semantic distance, conceptual alignment, and stylistic similarity.

Visual Heatmaps: A heatmap or graph that visually represents how the user’s passage matches or diverges in lexical, stylistic, and intellectual aspects.

Suggestions for Improvement: Based on the comparison, the app can suggest specific improvements to bring the passage more in line with the desired style or intellectual framework (e.g., "use more formal language", "reorganize arguments for better coherence", "incorporate more examples").

Output:

Detailed Report: A report that explains how the passage compares to the reference corpus, providing insights into where it aligns or diverges in terms of style, tone, and intellectual content.

Suggestions for Improvement: Based on the comparison, the app can generate actionable suggestions to help the user adjust their writing to fit the desired style or theoretical framework.

Example Instructions for Replit:
Input:

The user uploads a passage they want to compare.

The user uploads a larger reference document (e.g., paper, theorist's works, corpus of philosophical texts).

Output:

A comparison report that shows how similar the passage is to the reference.

Suggestions for improving the passage's style, tone, and intellectual rigor based on the comparison.

Additional Features:

Users can choose a specific theorist (e.g., Derrida, Marx, Kant) or a particular field (e.g., mathematics, literary theory, ethics).

The app will adjust the comparison logic based on the chosen reference (e.g., a Marxist framework vs. a Kantian framework).

Key Guidelines:

Lexical Similarity: Focus on vocabulary choice, tone, and complexity.

Syntactical Structure: Compare sentence construction, use of complex vs. simple sentences.

Intellectual Content: Ensure conceptual alignment, theoretical coherence with the reference.

Potential User Inputs:
Upload Passage:

“Upload the passage you want to compare.”

Upload Reference Corpus:

“Upload a body of work (full article, chapter, theorist’s text, etc.) for comparison.”

Theorist Selection (Optional):

“Choose a theorist or academic style to compare your writing to (e.g., Derrida, Marx, Kant, etc.).”

How This Works:
The user’s passage will be analyzed and compared against the reference corpus in terms of lexical choices, sentence structure, tone, and intellectual content.

The app will generate a score indicating how well the user’s writing aligns with the reference, along with a visual comparison (e.g., heatmap).

Actionable suggestions will be provided to guide the user in aligning their writing more closely with the desired style, tone, or intellectual framework.

Why This Will Work:
By allowing the user to upload any passage and compare it to a larger corpus or theorist’s style, Replit provides customized feedback on both style and substance.

The ability to compare with theoretical frameworks ensures that users can match their writing with specific intellectual traditions.

Visual heatmaps and detailed reports make the comparison easy to understand and actionable.
