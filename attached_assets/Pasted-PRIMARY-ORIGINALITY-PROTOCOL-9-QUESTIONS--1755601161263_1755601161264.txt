PRIMARY ORIGINALITY PROTOCOL - 9 QUESTIONS
============================================================

Document: Passage A
Analysis Date: 8/19/2025

1. IS IT ORIGINAL (NOT IN THE SENSE THAT IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID BUT IN THE SENSE THAT ONLY A FECUND MIND COULD COME UP WITH IT)?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "Reliabilism is a theory in epistemology that offers a compelling, process-oriented solution to the problem of defining knowledge..."
Explanation: The text is a competent synthesis of established ideas, not a product of fecundity. A Walmart patron could not produce this specific summary, but 85% could outperform in raw, unconventional insight (e.g., a mechanic intuiting reliability from engine diagnostics, a hunter from animal tracking—unpolished but generative thinking this text lacks). The score is revised from 10 to reflect that the author's synthesis has some minimal structural advantage over pure naivete.
Score: 15/100

2. ARE THE WAYS THE IDEAS ARE INTERCONNECTED ORIGINAL? OR ARE THOSE INTERCONNECTIONS CONVENTION-DRIVEN AND DOCTRINAIRE?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "This shifts the focus from the internal, conscious reasons a person might hold (as in traditional theories) to the external, objective reliability of the method itself."
Explanation: The interconnection is doctrinaire (internalism/externalism). 80% of patrons could outperform by making unconventional, if crude, connections (e.g., linking 'reliability' to trust in a spouse or a brand of tool, deriving a folk epistemology with accidental profundity). The author's connection is academically valid but unoriginal.
Score: 20/100

3. ARE IDEAS DEVELOPED IN A FRESH AND ORIGINAL WAY? OR IS THE IDEA-DEVELOPMENT MERELY ASSOCIATIVE, COMMONSENSE-BASED (OR COMMON-NONSENSE-BASED), OR DOCTRINAIRE?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "For instance, a belief formed through visual perception is justified... because vision is, under normal conditions, a highly reliable process."
Explanation: Development is associative and doctrinaire (standard vision example). 90% of patrons could outperform through fresh, if flawed, development (e.g., a cashier developing a 'reliable process' for spotting counterfeit money with unique heuristic reasoning). The author's development is a recitation of convention.
Score: 10/100

4. IS IT ORIGINAL RELATIVE TO THE DATASET THAT, JUDGING BY WHAT IT SAYS AND HOW IT SAYS IT, IT APPEARS TO BE ADDRESSING?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "This externalist approach elegantly explains how animals, children, or adults with spontaneously true beliefs can have knowledge..."
Explanation: It is unoriginal relative to its dataset (intro epistemology). 90% of patrons are not addressing this dataset; their 'work' (e.g., a farmer's original reasoning about weather patterns) is by definition original to their own domain, thus outperforming in relative originality. The author is a repeater within a closed system.
Score: 10/100

5. IS IT ORIGINAL IN A SUBSTANTIVE SENSE (IN THE SENSE IN WHICH BACH WAS ORIGINAL) OR ONLY IN A FRIVOLOUS TOKEN SENSE (THE SENSE IN WHICH SOMEBODY WHO RANDOMLY BANGS ON A PIANO IS 'ORIGINAL')?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "though it faces its own challenges in precisely defining 'reliable processes'..."
Explanation: It is tokenism (mentioning standard objections). 95% of patrons are not original in a Bach-like sense, but their 'originality' (e.g., a child's unique drawing) is at least non-derivative and not token. The author's tokenism is a lesser form of unoriginality, a mimicry of academic posture.
Score: 5/100

6. IS IT BOILERPLATE (OR IF IT, PER SE, IS NOT BOILER PLATE, IS IT THE RESULT OF APPLYING BOILER PLATE PROTOCOLS IN A BOILER PLATE WAY TO SOME DATASET)?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "Reliabilism is a theory in epistemology that offers a compelling, process-oriented solution..."
Explanation: It is boilerplate, a perfect application of academic summary protocol. 10% of patrons could produce non-boilerplate work (e.g., a heartfelt, rambling online review full of unique phrasing and structure). The author's work is high-competence boilerplate, so only 90% outperform in non-derivativeness.
Score: 90/100

7. WOULD SOMEBODY WHO HAD NOT READ IT, BUT WAS OTHERWISE EDUCATED AND INFORMED, COME WAY FROM IT BEING MORE ENGLIGHTED AND BETTER EQUIPPED TO ADJUDICATE INTELLECTUAL QUESTIONS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD HE COME UP CONFUSED WITH NOTHING TANGIBLE TO SHOW FOR IT?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "It posits that a belief is justified, and thus can count as knowledge when true, if it is produced by a cognitive process that is reliably truth-conducive."
Explanation: An educated reader gains a clear, accurate definition—a tangible tool. 25% of patrons could provide something more enlightening (e.g., a craftsman's pithy, insightful rule of thumb born of experience). The author's definition is superior to most folk explanation, hence a score of 75.
Score: 75/100

8. WOULD SOMEBODY READING IT COME AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE WITH INSIGHTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE HARD TO ACQUIRE THAT HOLD UP IN GENERAL?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "This shifts the focus from the internal, conscious reasons... to the external, objective reliability..."
Explanation: The insight is not hard to acquire; it is epistemology 101. 85% of patrons could provide insights harder to acquire (e.g., a gambler's nuanced, non-academic understanding of probability and risk through loss). The author provides a polished common insight.
Score: 15/100

9. OR WOULD WHATEVER HIS TAKEAWAY WAS HAVE VALIDITY ONLY RELATIVE TO VALIDITIES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO SOME AUTHOR OR SYSTEM AND PROBABLY DO NOT HAVE MUCH OBJECTIVE LEGITIMACY?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "This externalist approach elegantly explains how animals, children, or adults with spontaneously true beliefs can have knowledge..."
Explanation: The takeaway has high objective legitimacy (correct summary of a major philosophical theory). 20% of patrons would produce work with less legitimacy (e.g., conspiracy theories). The author's work is valid within a robust intellectual tradition, outperforming most lay reasoning in legitimacy.
Score: 80/100
