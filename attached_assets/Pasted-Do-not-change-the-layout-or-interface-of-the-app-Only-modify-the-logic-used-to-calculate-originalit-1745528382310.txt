Do not change the layout or interface of the app. Only modify the logic used to calculate originality and depth scores.

This patch corrects a scoring error where texts that reframe core concepts (e.g., "emotions are judgments") are being misclassified as less original or deep than more rhetorically polished, but derivative, texts.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. In the originality scoring function, add the following criteria:

    a. Increase originality score if the text:
        - Reclassifies a common-sense distinction (e.g., emotions vs. judgments)
        - Introduces or distinguishes conceptual frameworks (e.g., egocentric vs. non-egocentric reasoning)
        - Offers ontological or epistemological reinterpretations of familiar concepts

    b. Decrease originality score if the text:
        - Primarily summarizes or applies existing models without modification
        - Contains phrases like "I will not try to prove this is superior" or "my aims are modest"
        - Derives its structure from reacting to standard objections rather than proposing new frames

2. In the depth scoring function:

    a. Increase depth score if:
        - The passage introduces identity conditions or redefinitions of concepts
        - It addresses the nature of mental states, rationality, or cognitive architecture
        - It has implications for other branches of philosophy (e.g., epistemology, philosophy of mind)

    b. Decrease depth score if:
        - The passage simply outlines a position and replies to objections without foundational revision
        - It avoids commitment to new definitions or frameworks

3. Retain the current coherence, clarity, and accuracy logic â€” no changes needed there.

4. Apply this logic regardless of subject domain (ethics, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, etc.).

5. Output the scores in the exact same UI location and format as before.

Make sure these logic changes override any old weighting systems or similarity-based metrics that may bias against structurally original content.
