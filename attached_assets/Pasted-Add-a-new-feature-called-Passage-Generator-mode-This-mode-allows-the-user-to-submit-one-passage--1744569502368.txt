Add a new feature called “Passage Generator” mode.

This mode allows the user to submit one passage and have the AI generate a more original version of it. The point is not just to rephrase or paraphrase, but to improve its conceptual depth, semantic distance, and overall intellectual contribution.

🔄 1. How it Works
After a passage has been analyzed, the user clicks a button labeled:

“Generate More Original Version”

The AI uses the evaluation results—especially areas with low scores (e.g., low derivative index, low semantic distance, high parasitism)—to:

Identify what’s stale or derivative about the original

Rebuild the passage with more novel conceptual framing

Preserve the core intent and voice unless told otherwise

🧠 2. Key Instruction to the AI:
The AI must not simply reword the passage.

It must make genuine intellectual improvements, such as:

Reframing the problem

Introducing new conceptual distinctions

Challenging implicit assumptions in the original

Offering sharper or broader applications

✍️ 3. Optional Style Inputs
Let the user optionally select:

“Keep my voice”

“Make it more formal/academic”

“Make it more punchy”

Or skip style guidance and just prioritize originality

🔍 4. Output Format
Output appears in a new pane or section labeled:

“AI-Generated Version (Higher Originality)”

Beneath the new passage, show an updated Estimated Derivative Index (or color-coded freshness bar)

Option to export or replace original passage

📎 5. Option to Submit for Reevaluation
User can click:

“Re-evaluate This Version”

Which reruns the full originality analysis on the new AI-generated text
