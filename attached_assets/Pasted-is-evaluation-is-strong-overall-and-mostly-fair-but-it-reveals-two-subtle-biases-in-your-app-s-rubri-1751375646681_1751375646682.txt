is evaluation is strong overall‚Äîand mostly fair‚Äîbut it reveals two subtle biases in your app's rubric logic. Here's a breakdown:

‚úÖ WHAT THE EVALUATION GETS RIGHT
1. Accurate Argument Summary
The summary and reconstruction reflect real understanding of the paper‚Äôs aim and method. No hallucinations or superficial paraphrasing. That‚Äôs solid.

2. Cognitive Risk (90/100)
Correctly scores the ambition and originality of the project. Extending G√∂del‚Äôs incompleteness to logic itself via recursion theory is nontrivial, and the model rightly rewards that.

3. Conceptual Precision (88/100)
This is high and deserved. The paper is technically sharp; the definitions are tight. Any residual vagueness is more due to compression than sloppiness.

‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT THE EVALUATION GETS WRONG
1. Undervaluing Inferential Cohesion (80/100)
"Some steps could be more explicitly detailed..."

This misses the mark. The proofs are stylized as proof sketches‚Äîstandard in formal logic where the lemmas (e.g. Cantor, diagonalization) are well known. There are no invalid steps‚Äîjust economical ones.

Verdict: Penalizing brevity in a proof sketch is a misunderstanding of domain norms. This should be closer to 90.

2. Misapplied ‚ÄúEpistemic Control‚Äù (78/100)
"Could better delineate the scope and limitations..."

This is overstated. The scope is delineated: recursive truth-generating logics. It doesn‚Äôt claim to cover non-recursive or paraconsistent logics.

If anything, the paper could benefit from an explicit acknowledgment of this boundary‚Äîbut lack of explicit disclaimer ‚â† overreach.

Verdict: Should be in the mid-80s.

3. Counterargument Handling (75/100)
Fair to note, but misleading in this context. In mathematics and logic, direct refutation of alternative views isn‚Äôt always necessary. The proof speaks for itself. This isn‚Äôt a humanities-style paper where you rebut critics‚Äîit‚Äôs a formal generalization.

Still, if you wanted to optimize cogency for a mixed audience, you could add a ‚ÄúPreemptive Objections‚Äù section.

Verdict: Mild penalty is fine, but not 75. Should be ~80.

üîß SUGGESTED CORRECTIONS TO YOUR RUBRIC
Parameter	Fix
Inferential Cohesion	Reward compression with validity; penalize gaps, not efficiency.
Epistemic Control	Don‚Äôt penalize lack of disclaimers unless overclaiming actually occurs.
Counterarguments	Adjust weight based on genre (e.g. formal vs argumentative prose).

üß† Meta-Insight:
Your rubric sometimes treats formal texts like persuasive essays. But in formal logic, cogency is the proof. That‚Äôs the domain-standard metric. So while this report is mostly intelligent and structured, it needs a tighter tether to domain expectations.
