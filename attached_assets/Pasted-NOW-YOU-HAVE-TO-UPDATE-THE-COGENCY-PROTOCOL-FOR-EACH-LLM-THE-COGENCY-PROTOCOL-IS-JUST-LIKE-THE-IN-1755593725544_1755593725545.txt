NOW YOU HAVE TO UPDATE THE COGENCY PROTOCOL (FOR EACH LLM). THE COGENCY PROTOCOL IS JUST LIKE THE INTELLIGENCE PROTOCOL EXCEPT THAT IT IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: IS THE POINT BEING DEFENDED (IF THERE IS ONE) SHARP ENOUGH THAT IT DOES NOT NEED ARGUMENTATION? 
DOES THE REASONING DEFEND THE POINT BEING ARGUED IN THE RIGHT WAYS? 
DOES THE REASONING ONLY DEFEND THE ARGUED FOR POINT AGAINST STRAWMEN? 
DOES THE REASONING DEVELOP THE POINT PER SE? IE DOES THE REASONING SHOW THAT THE POINT ITSELF IS STRONG?
OR DOES IT 'DEFEND' IT ONLY BY SHOWING THAT VARIOUS AUTHORITIES DO OR WOULD APPROVE OF IT? 
IS THE POINT SHARP? IF NOT, IS IT SHARPLY DEFENDED? 
IS THE REASONING GOOD ONLY IN A TRIVIAL 'DEBATING' SENSE? OR IS IT GOOD IN THE SENSE THAT IT WOULD LIKELY MAKE AN INTELLIGENT PERSON 
RECONSIDER HIS POSITION?
IS THE REASONING INVOLVED IN DEFENDING THE KEY CLAIM ABOUT ACTUALLY ESTABLISHING THAT CLAIM? OR IS IT MORE ABOUT OBFUSCATING? 
DOES THE REASONING HELP ILLUMINATE THE MERITS OF THE CLAIM? OR DOES IT JUST SHOW THAT THE CLAIM IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF SOME (FALSE OR TRIVIAL) PRESUMPTION?
IS THE 'REASONING' IN FACT REASONING? OR IS IT JUST A SERIES OF LATER STATEMENTS THAT CONNECT ONLY SUPERFICIALLY (E.G. BY REFERENCING THE SAME KEY TERMS
OR AUTHORS) TO THE ORIGINAL? 
IF COGENT, IS IT COGENT IN THE SENSE THAT A PERSON OF INTELLIGENCE WHO PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT OTHERWISE WOULD NOW TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY? OR IS IT 
COGENT ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT IT DOES IN FACT PROVIDE AN ARGUMENT AND TOUCH ALL THE RIGHT (MIDDLE-SCHOOL COMPOSITION CLASS) BASES? IN OTHER WORDS,
IS THE ARGUMENTATION TOKEN AND PRO FORMA OR DOES IT ACTUALLY SERVE THE FUNCTION OF SHOWING THE IDEA TO HAVE MERIT? 
DOES THE 'ARGUMENTATION' SHOW THAT THE IDEA MAY WELL BE CORRECT? OR DOES IT RATHER SHOW THAT IT HAS TO BE 'ACCEPTED' (IN THE SENSE THAT ONE WILL
BE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF SOME PANEL OF 'EXPERTS' IF ONE THINKS OTHERWISE)? 
TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE COGENCY OF THE POINT/REASONING DERIVE FROM THE POINT ITSELF? AND TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT SUPERIMPOSED ON IT BY TORTURED ARGUMENTATION?
