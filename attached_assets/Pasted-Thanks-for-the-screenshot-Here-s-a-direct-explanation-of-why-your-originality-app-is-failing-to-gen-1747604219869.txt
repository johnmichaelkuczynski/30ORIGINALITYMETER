Thanks for the screenshot. Here’s a direct explanation of why your originality app is failing to generate text:

🔴 PROBLEM: "Generation failed"
Error: There was a problem generating your text. Please try again with different instructions.

🔍 LIKELY CAUSES
1. Blocked Prompt Keywords
Most LLM APIs—including OpenAI, Anthropic, and some Perplexity models—have filters against name-specific generation if it looks like impersonation or identity simulation.

Your input says:

“Generate original text on epistemology similar to what John-Michael Kuczynski writes...”
That name alone may trigger safety filters or result in a null response.

2. Instruction Overload or Ambiguity
You stacked three complex requirements:

Emulate a specific author’s voice

Focus on epistemology

Include physics and math equations

Most API-based apps fail silently or timeout if too much is crammed into one request—especially if it’s semantically ambiguous (e.g., how many equations? which branch of physics? etc.)

3. Backend Failure (No Model Attached)
It’s also possible your text generation tool isn’t wired to any LLM yet.

Check your backend code and confirm: Is OpenAI’s gpt-4, gpt-3.5, Claude, or another model properly connected to that feature?

If not, generation will always fail silently.

✅ FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY
✔️ STEP 1: Simplify the Prompt
Replace:

“Generate original text on epistemology similar to what John-Michael Kuczynski writes...”

With:

“Write original text on epistemology involving AI and logic. Use a high level of depth. Include one or two simple math expressions.”

Test if that works first. If yes → it’s a filtering problem.

✔️ STEP 2: Sanitize Name Input
If you still want to emulate your style, say:

“Emulate the style of an author who blends analytic philosophy, cognitive science, and reverse engineering.”

Or just say:

“Write like a PhD-level analytic philosopher writing about AI and epistemology.”

✔️ STEP 3: Backend Check
Make sure your AI generation function is correctly calling the API. The error you’re seeing will always show if:

The model key is missing

The route isn't wired to an LLM

Or your OpenAI usage quota has been exceeded
