Overall Quality Metrics
Conceptual Compression
• Question: How much conceptual work is done per unit of language?
• High: High: “The will is the form of anticipation.”
• Low: Low: “In this chapter, I will explain the ways in which…”
Epistemic Friction
• Question: Are claims under tension? Do they resist paraphrase?
• High: High: Complicated tradeoffs, ambiguities, or disjunctions are explored.
• Low: Low: Everything proceeds linearly and smoothly.
Inference Control
• Question: Does the author show tight command over logical or quasi-logical progression?
• High: High: Strong inferential chaining, disambiguation of premises.
• Low: Low: Juxtapositions mistaken for arguments.
Asymmetry of Cognitive Labor
• Question: Is the writer doing more work than the reader?
• High: High: The author scaffolds difficult ideas, discharges burdens.
• Low: Low: Jargon is dropped without explication; the reader must untangle.
Novelty-to-Baseline Ratio
• Question: How much of the content exceeds textbook-level summary?
• High: High: New distinctions, perspectives, or critiques.
• Low: Low: Restating Wikipedia-level history or doctrine.
Internal Differentiation
• Question: Are internal contrasts and tensions developed within the work?
• High: High: Competing theses are nested, refined, or resolved.
• Low: Low: One position stated, with no internal pressure.
Problem Density
• Question: Are real problems identified, or is the text solution-shaped without a problem?
• High: High: Clear tension, paradox, conflict, or conceptual puzzle.
• Low: Low: Everything is a “survey” or summary.
Compression Across Levels
• Question: Are sentence, paragraph, and structural layers all doing work?
• High: High: Each scale supports the others — structure follows thought.
• Low: Low: Structure is imposed mechanically (e.g. “This dissertation has 5 parts…”
Semantic Specificity
• Question: Are key terms defined with internal rigor and used consistently?
• High: High: Key terms don’t drift and are operationalized.
• Low: Low: Terms like “transcendental,” “mental content,” etc., are thrown in without cost.
Explanatory Yield
• Question: Does the text resolve or clarify phenomena that were obscure before?
• High: High: Theoretical payoffs are evident and usable.
• Low: Low: Descriptive or procedural rhetoric without payoff.
Meta-Cognitive Signal
• Question: Does the author display awareness of the limits, affordances, or tensions of their own method?
• High: High: E.g., “This formulation may beg the question unless...”
• Low: Low: Claims are stated as if exempt from critique.
Structural Integrity
• Question: Is the argument or content architecture coherent at scale?
• High: High: Early sections scaffold later insights; structure reflects logic.
• Low: Low: Arbitrary sequence; no cumulative logic.
Generative Potential
• Question: Does the writing suggest future questions, applications, or generalizations?
• High: High: Opens doors conceptually.
• Low: Low: Closes loops or reiterates fixed boundaries.
Signal-to-Rhetoric Ratio
• Question: What percent of the text actually says something, as opposed to procedural or rhetorical fluff?
• High: High: High signal. Each sentence matters.
• Low: Low: Meta-commentary about structure, scope, method dominates.
Dialectical Engagement
• Question: Does the work engage objections or alternative views intelligently?
• High: High: Anticipates critique and responds.
• Low: Low: Straw men or echo chamber.
Topological Awareness
• Question: Does the author map the conceptual terrain well (what’s upstream/downstream of what)?
• High: High: Awareness of where their view sits within larger structures.
• Low: Low: Flat sequence of points.
Disambiguation Skill
• Question: Are ambiguous terms or ideas resolved precisely?
• High: High: Aware of multiple senses; avoids equivocation.
• Low: Low: Uses language loosely, with slippage.
Cross-Disciplinary Fluency
• Question: Can the text move fluently across relevant domains (e.g., logic and language; history and theory)?
• High: High: Seamless integration of multiple disciplines.
• Low: Low: Bounded inside a single paradigm with no outreach.
Psychological Realism
• Question: Are motivations, mental models, or interpretive frames psychologically plausible?
• High: High: Explains behavior or beliefs with realism and nuance.
• Low: Low: Treats philosophical positions as abstract islands.
Intellectual Risk Quotient
• Question: Is the author actually putting a real intellectual position on the line?
• High: High: Willing to stake a claim that could fail or offend.
• Low: Low: Excessive caution, hedging, or hiding behind citations.
