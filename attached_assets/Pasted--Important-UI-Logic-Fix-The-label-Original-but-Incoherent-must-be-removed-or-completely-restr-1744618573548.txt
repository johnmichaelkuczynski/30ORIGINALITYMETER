⚠️ Important UI & Logic Fix: The label “Original but Incoherent” must be removed or completely restructured.

Right now, the app displays a category label like “Original but Incoherent” as if it’s a standalone metric—a kind of hybrid verdict between originality and coherence.

This is fundamentally confused. Here’s why:

🔍 1. Originality and Coherence Are Distinct Metrics
Originality (measured by Semantic Distance, Novelty, etc.) tells us how conceptually new the content is.

Coherence (measured independently) tells us whether the passage makes sense structurally.

These should remain strictly separate. There is no such thing as “originality with incoherence” being a third metric. That’s like saying “speed but without direction” is its own quantity.

🛑 2. “Original but Incoherent” Is Not a Score
It is currently being displayed as if it were a value or a rating, sometimes even with a visual bar.

But it’s just a verbal mashup of two separate axes. It shouldn’t be rendered like a metric.

This confuses users, who assume there’s a coherent basis or calculation behind that phrase. There isn’t.

✅ 3. What to Do Instead
Option A: Show Originality and Coherence Separately
Just give the user:

Originality Score (0–10)

Coherence Score (0–10)

Leave it to them to interpret.

Option B: Add an Aggregate Score (But Be Transparent)
Create an Aggregate Quality Score, calculated from weighted originality + coherence.

E.g. Aggregate = 0.5 * originality + 0.5 * coherence

Or even a smarter rule: “If coherence is below 4, originality is capped at 6”

Show this aggregate as a separate, distinct field, e.g.:

Overall Quality Score: 6.3/10

Option C: Use a 2×2 Label Grid (if you insist on verbal categories)
Map passages into:

Coherent	Incoherent
Original	✅ High Quality	⚠️ Promising but Fragmented
Derivative	🟡 Clear but Unoriginal	❌ Low Value
This keeps the categorical label but prevents it from being treated as a metric.

🚫 Bottom Line:
❌ “Original but Incoherent” should not be shown as a standalone metric or bar
✅ Separate originality and coherence cleanly, or calculate a true aggregate if needed.
