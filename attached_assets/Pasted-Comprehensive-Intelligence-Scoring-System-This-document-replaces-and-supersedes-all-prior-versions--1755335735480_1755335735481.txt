Comprehensive Intelligence Scoring System
This document replaces and supersedes all prior versions of the Intelligence Meter cognitive metrics. It incorporates both the foundational cognitive dimensions outlined in the original document Intelligence_Meter_Cognitive_Metrics.docx and the essential upgrades articulated in recent corrections. In particular, it clearly separates negative (gatekeeping) metrics from the single affirmative (insight-generating) metric that determines true intelligence.

I. STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW
Negative Metrics = Gatekeepers. If a text fails these, it is unintelligent. If it passes, it might be intelligent.
Affirmative Metric = Generator. If a text succeeds here, it is intelligent—regardless of how well it performs on the negative metrics.

II. AFFIRMATIVE INTELLIGENCE METRIC
1. Affirmative Insight Function (AIF)
Question: Does this text tell me something I wouldn’t have realized on my own, even if I’m very smart?
•	Insight must be non-redundant with respect to the reader’s prior semantic topology
•	Must expand awareness in a non-paraphrasable way
•	Must contain asymmetric novelty: something that once known cannot be “unlearned” without loss
✅ This is the only metric that directly measures actual intelligence. Everything else is a screen.

III. NEGATIVE (GATEKEEPER) METRICS
These metrics screen out low-quality or pseudo-intelligent prose. They are necessary but not sufficient for intelligence.
2. Semantic Compression
How much meaning is packed into few words? - High = compact density with implication - Low = padded, verbose, diluted prose
3. Inferential Control
How well are claims logically connected? - High = tight causal chains or deductive scaffolding - Low = leapfrogging, handwaving
4. Cognitive Risk
Does the text make bold, unpopular, or non-obvious claims? - High = epistemically risky moves - Low = platitudes or obvious truisms
5. Meta-Theoretical Awareness
Is the text aware of its own framework or assumptions? - High = recursive modeling and self-situating - Low = naive or one-layered discourse
6. Conceptual Innovation
Does the text create new categories, terms, distinctions? - High = fresh language or paradigms - Low = jargon recitation or term recycling
7. Epistemic Resistance
How much work does the reader have to do? - High = slows digestion; demands rereading - Low = sugarcoated, frictionless
8. Signal-to-Fluff Ratio
How much of the prose is intellectually necessary? - High = no waste, no filler - Low = verbal noise, padding, vague rhetoric
9. Abstraction Control
Can the author move between example and principle? - High = abstraction-flexible - Low = stuck at one tier (too abstract or too concrete)
10. Semantic Asymmetry
Are the ideas directionally structured (e.g., X implies Y, but not vice versa)? - High = structural complexity - Low = reciprocal mush
11. Compression-to-Novelty Ratio
Is the text both compact and new? - High = maximum insight per word - Low = verbose redundancy or novelty without clarity

IV. SUPPLEMENTARY / SPECIALIZED METRICS
(Only used in special domains or technical contexts)
•	Causal Modeling Skill: Can model layered causes well
•	Temporal Framing Control: Skill in narrative pacing
•	Psychological Plausibility: Motivations that track with human nature
•	Cross-Domain Synthesis: Interdisciplinary fusion
•	Error Correction Reflex: Preempts objections or self-revises midstream
________________________________________
V. META-METRIC
Epistemic Coherence Topology
Describes the architecture of argument: do the parts support each other in a load-bearing way? - High = multi-axis structure, stable under challenge - Low = brittle linear chains or incoherent mesh

VI. FINAL SCORING PHILOSOPHY
•	If a text fails any negative metric, it should be flagged as pseudo-intelligent or weak
•	If a text passes all gatekeeper metrics, it earns the right to be evaluated for actual intelligence
•	Only a high Affirmative Insight Function (AIF) score justifies high overall intelligence placement
Genius = High AIF + High Resistance + High Compression + High Innovation
Pseudointelligence = High Coherence + Low Insight + Safe Claims
Garbage = Fails compression, inference, and signal ratio
________________________________________
This document defines a robust, non-gameable, philosophically grounded intelligence scoring system designed for real-world use in evaluating academic prose, essays, and AI-generated outputs. No metric alone suffices; only their composite—and the primacy of insight—yields valid evaluation.
