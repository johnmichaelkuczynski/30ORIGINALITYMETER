PRIMARY ORIGINALITY PROTOCOL - 9 QUESTIONS
============================================================

Document: Passage A
Analysis Date: 8/19/2025

1. IS IT ORIGINAL (NOT IN THE SENSE THAT IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID BUT IN THE SENSE THAT ONLY A FECUND MIND COULD COME UP WITH IT)?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "It seems to me that this Sellarsian line of thought was put forth by Berkeley in 1709."
Explanation: The author explicitly acknowledges that the central insight is not original, tracing it back to Berkeley in 1709. The passage is primarily an exposition and application of existing philosophical ideas rather than novel theoretical development. While the specific examples (tie-shop, stop signs) may be contemporary, the fundamental insight about the role of background knowledge in perception is acknowledged as historically established. The intellectual work here is more exegetical than generative.
Score: 25/100

2. ARE THE WAYS THE IDEAS ARE INTERCONNECTED ORIGINAL? OR ARE THOSE INTERCONNECTIONS CONVENTION-DRIVEN AND DOCTRINAIRE?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "By exactly analogous arguments, it can be shown that any episode of taking in information about the external world – any episode of taking in the height or speed or shape…or color of an object – involves the co-operation of contextual or background information."
Explanation: The interconnections follow a predictable pattern of analogical reasoning. The author systematically applies the same template (appearance ambiguity requiring contextual resolution) across different perceptual domains (color, shape, size, distance). While this creates coherence, it represents conventional philosophical methodology rather than innovative conceptual synthesis. The connections are logical extensions rather than surprising or illuminating juxtapositions that reveal hidden relationships.
Score: 45/100

3. ARE IDEAS DEVELOPED IN A FRESH AND ORIGINAL WAY? OR IS THE IDEA-DEVELOPMENT MERELY ASSOCIATIVE, COMMONSENSE-BASED (OR COMMON-NONSENSE-BASED), OR DOCTRINAIRE?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "A ten foot stop-sign, looked at from a hundred feet away, gives off the same appearance as 1,000 foot stop sign looked at from 10,000 feet away. But when one looks at a stop sign from a hundred feet away, one isn't fooled for a second"
Explanation: The development relies heavily on intuitive, commonsense examples that appeal to everyday experience. The stop sign and diamond/square examples are straightforward illustrations rather than penetrating analyses that reveal unexpected dimensions of the problem. The argumentation proceeds through obvious cases rather than challenging edge cases or counterexamples that might deepen understanding. The approach is pedagogically clear but intellectually predictable.
Score: 40/100

4. IS IT ORIGINAL RELATIVE TO THE DATASET THAT, JUDGING BY WHAT IT SAYS AND HOW IT SAYS IT, IT APPEARS TO BE ADDRESSING?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "Sellars has shown that in non-standard conditions, one must rely (however unconsciously) on background knowledge if one is to learn, through one's senses, how things are in the external world."
Explanation: Within the context of philosophy of perception and epistemology, this represents standard exposition of well-established positions. The passage operates within conventional frameworks of the Sellars-Berkeley tradition without challenging or significantly extending these approaches. For an audience familiar with this philosophical literature, the treatment offers little that would be surprising or theoretically innovative, functioning more as competent summary than original contribution.
Score: 35/100

5. IS IT ORIGINAL IN A SUBSTANTIVE SENSE (IN THE SENSE IN WHICH BACH WAS ORIGINAL) OR ONLY IN A FRIVOLOUS TOKEN SENSE (THE SENSE IN WHICH SOMEBODY WHO RANDOMLY BANGS ON A PIANO IS 'ORIGINAL')?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "If there were perfectly 'standard' conditions, they would not be standard. If we could set up a situation that was distortion free, that situation would not be a typical one."
Explanation: The passage lacks substantive originality. While it contains some clever formulations like the paradox of standard conditions, these represent rhetorical flourishes rather than deep theoretical innovations. The work resembles competent academic exposition more than transformative intellectual contribution. Unlike Bach's substantive innovations within musical structure, this passage rearranges familiar philosophical materials without creating new conceptual architectures or solving standing problems.
Score: 20/100

6. IS IT BOILERPLATE (OR IF IT, PER SE, IS NOT BOILER PLATE, IS IT THE RESULT OF APPLYING BOILER PLATE PROTOCOLS IN A BOILER PLATE WAY TO SOME DATASET)?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "We can tell at a glance what shape an object has. But the appearance that a diamond-shaped object gives off when looked at from above is the same as the appearance that a square shaped object gives off when looked at from an oblique angle."
Explanation: The passage follows standard philosophical protocols: present a thesis, offer illustrative examples, generalize the principle, trace historical precedents. The argumentation structure is formulaic, and the examples (geometric shapes, familiar objects) are the kind of stock cases used in introductory philosophy courses. While not pure boilerplate, it represents the application of conventional philosophical methodology in conventional ways to conventional problems.
Score: 70/100

7. WOULD SOMEBODY WHO HAD NOT READ IT, BUT WAS OTHERWISE EDUCATED AND INFORMED, COME WAY FROM IT BEING MORE ENGLIGHTED AND BETTER EQUIPPED TO ADJUDICATE INTELLECTUAL QUESTIONS?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "In the absence of background empirical knowledge, our sensory episodes become indeterminate to the point of meaninglessness – to the point of having no representational content."
Explanation: The passage does provide genuine insight into the complexity of perception and the role of background knowledge in empirical judgment. An educated reader would gain appreciation for how much interpretive work underlies apparently simple perceptual acts. The systematic treatment helps readers recognize the philosophical sophistication required to understand perception, which could inform their approach to epistemological questions and debates about the reliability of sensory experience.
Score: 65/100

8. WOULD SOMEBODY READING IT COME AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE WITH INSIGHTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE HARD TO ACQUIRE THAT HOLD UP IN GENERAL?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "One compares the sign to the trees in its vicinity; and one knows, on independent grounds, that trees (at least outside of northern California) are usually between 15 and 80 ft tall: one can thus use these trees as benchmarks."
Explanation: The passage offers some insights that transfer beyond philosophy, particularly regarding how contextual information shapes interpretation in any domain involving ambiguous data. The recognition that perception requires background knowledge has applications in fields like artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and data interpretation. However, these insights are not particularly hard to acquire through other means, and much of the philosophical framework may not hold up outside academic contexts.
Score: 55/100

9. IF YOU GAVE A ROBOT THE DATASET TO WHICH THE PASSAGE IS A RESPONSE, WOULD THE ROBOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE IT (OR SOMETHING VERY MUCH LIKE IT)?
----------------------------------------
Quotation: "But standard conditions are an idealization: no conditions are really standard. If there were perfectly 'standard' conditions, they would not be standard."
Explanation: Much of this passage follows predictable patterns that a sophisticated AI could replicate: take a philosophical thesis, provide analogous examples across different domains, trace historical precedents, and conclude with generalizations. The argumentation structure, example selection, and even some of the rhetorical moves (like the standard conditions paradox) represent recognizable templates. While the prose is competent, it doesn't exhibit the kind of unexpected connections or deep theoretical insights that would be difficult to generate algorithmically from the relevant philosophical literature.
Score: 80/100
