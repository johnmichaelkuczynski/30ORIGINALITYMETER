Intelligence Metrics
Compression Capacity
• Question: Can complex ideas be expressed in compact form without loss?
• High: High: Dense formulations yield insight with minimal words.
• Low: Low: Rambling, bloated expression reveals conceptual weakness.
Multi-Level Integration
• Question: Can the author operate across multiple levels (abstract/concrete, meta/object)?
• High: High: Seamless transitions between layers of analysis.
• Low: Low: Stuck on one plane.
Dynamic Constraint Handling
• Question: Does the thinker maintain coherence under complex constraints?
• High: High: Manages tradeoffs without collapsing precision.
• Low: Low: Ignores or oversimplifies conflicting demands.
Inference Architecture
• Question: Are ideas constructed with deep, layered inferential scaffolding?
• High: High: Multi-step reasoning with structural memory.
• Low: Low: Shallow or linear logic.
Epistemic Risk Management
• Question: Does the thinker show awareness of the riskiness of their claims?
• High: High: Risky claims managed with discipline.
• Low: Low: Reckless or excessively cautious.
Cognitive Friction Tolerance
• Question: Can the thinker endure unresolved tensions?
• High: High: Holds dissonance productively.
• Low: Low: Rushes to resolution or avoids it.
Strategic Ambiguity Deployment
• Question: Can ambiguity be used intentionally and effectively?
• High: High: Selective ambiguity to provoke thought.
• Low: Low: Unintentional or incoherent.
Representational Versatility
• Question: Can the thinker switch formats as needed?
• High: High: Moves between diagrams, prose, math, analogy.
• Low: Low: Rigidly sticks to one mode.
Recursive Self-Monitoring
• Question: Does the thinker reflect on their own moves?
• High: High: Meta-awareness present.
• Low: Low: Blind to own method.
Conceptual Novelty with Coherence
• Question: Are new ideas viable and structured?
• High: High: Original and operationalizable.
• Low: Low: Performative or incoherent.
Noise Suppression
• Question: Can the thinker focus on signal?
• High: High: Ignores distractions.
• Low: Low: Chases tangents.
Abductive Strength
• Question: Are best-explanation arguments creatively but plausibly formed?
• High: High: Surprising but cogent hypotheses.
• Low: Low: Appealing but unsupported.
Causal Finesse
• Question: Are causal relations modeled with nuance?
• High: High: Layered causal logic.
• Low: Low: Simple linear cause-effect.
Boundary Perception
• Question: Are the limits of scope/method recognized?
• High: High: Aware of constraints.
• Low: Low: Overreach or blind spots.
Temporal Layering
• Question: Can change over time be tracked structurally?
• High: High: Coherent historical/evolutionary logic.
• Low: Low: Timeless or inert.
Intellectual Empathy
• Question: Are opposing views reconstructed fairly?
• High: High: Strong steelmanning.
• Low: Low: Straw men.
Conceptual Mobility
• Question: Can the thinker shift between domains?
• High: High: Fluid conceptual transitions.
• Low: Low: Stuck in one paradigm.
Error Assimilation
• Question: Can mistakes be integrated into thinking?
• High: High: Errors are processed productively.
• Low: Low: Hidden or denied.
Pattern Extraction
• Question: Can deep structure be detected across variation?
• High: High: Generalizes across difference.
• Low: Low: Stays at surface.
Semantic Topology Awareness
• Question: Are dependencies between ideas tracked?
• High: High: Conceptual terrain is mapped.
• Low: Low: Flat or meandering flow.
