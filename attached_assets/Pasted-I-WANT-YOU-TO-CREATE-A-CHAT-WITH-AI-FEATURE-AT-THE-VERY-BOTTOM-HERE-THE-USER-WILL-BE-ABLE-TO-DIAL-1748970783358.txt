I WANT YOU TO CREATE A ‘CHAT WITH AI’ FEATURE AT THE VERY BOTTOM. HERE THE USER WILL BE ABLE TO DIALOGUE WITH AI ABOUT ANYTHING, INCLUDING WHAT IS IN THE BOXES ABOVE. THERE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE ANYTING IN THE ABOVE BOXES FOR THE USER TO USE THIS FUNCTION; HE CAN USE THE WAY HE WOULD USE CHATGPT. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS AWARE OF WHAT IS IN THE ABOVE BOXES (INPUT, OUPUT ETC). MOREOVER, THE USER HAS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEND BLOCKS OF TEXT FROM THE CHAT WITH AI FUNCTION TO THE INPUT BOX. HERE IS THE IDEA. THE USER WANTS TO GENERATE AN ORIGINAL PIECE OF WRITING (ABOUT TOPOLOGY OR PHILOSOPHY OR ASTRONOMY OR WHATEVER); SO HE ASKS THE APP TO DO THIS IN THE CHAT WITH  AI FUNCTION; THE APP DOES IT; BUT THEN THE USER NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SEND THE newly generated document—WITH PERFECT NOTATION (IF IT'S MATH OR INVOLVES MATH OR TECHNICAL NOTATION)—TO THE INPUT BOX WHERE HE CAN PROCESS IT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS? THE PURPOSE OF THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS TO LET THE USER GENERATE FRESH IDEAS ON THE SPOT AND TEST THEM FOR ORIGINALITY (AND WHATEVER ELSE THE APP TESTS); IE THIS WAY THE USER IS NOT LOCKED INTO USING OLD SAMPLES; HE CAN USE THE APP IS AN ENGINE OF THOUGHT-GENERATION, AS OPPOSED TO JUST AN ENGINE OF EVALUATION. MOREOVER, HE CAN COPY-PASTE THE SAMPLE HE IS GOING TO USE INTO THE AI CHAT (OR UPLOAD IT OR DRAG AND DROP IT…THE AI CHAT WILL HAVE UPLOAD ABILITY, INCLUDING OCR FOR BOTH TEXT AND MATH…USE MATHPIX) AND CAN DISCUSS IT AND MODIFY IT IN THE AI-CHAT AND THEN SEND A NEW VERSION TO THE INPUT BOX WITH JUST THE CLICK OF A BUTTON.THIS WAY THE APP ‘CLOSES THE LOOP’; IT ALLOWS (1) GENERATION, (2) EVALUATION, AND (3) REGENERATION IN LIGHT OF EVALUATION—IN PERPETUITY. DO YOU FOLLOW?
 ALSO, THE USER HAS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEND BLOCKS OF TEXT FROM THE CHAT WITH AI FUNCTION TO THE INPUT BOX. HERE IS THE IDEA. THE USER WANTS TO GENERATE AN EXAM ABOUT TOPOLOGY (OR WHATEVER); SO HE ASKS THE APP TO DO THIS IN THE CHAT WITH  AI FUNCTION; THE APP DOES IT; BUT THEN THE USER NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SEND THE ASSIGNMENT—WITH PERFECT NOTATION—TO THE INPUT BOX WHERE HE CAN PROCESS IT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS? DO YOU? TELL ME WHAT YOU TINK I WANT. FINALLY, WHEN THE USER UPLOADS A PDF OR WORD OR IMAGE, THE APP DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLYK PROCESS IT. THE APP DOES NOT PROCESS UNTL THE USER HITS THE ‘PROCESS’ BUTTON. THIS IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE THE USER MAY HAVE TO LOAD MORE MATERIAL OR SIMPLYK THINK. AND YOU WILL CREATE ‘ENTER’ FUNCTIONALITYI SO THE USER CAN JUST HIT ‘ENTER’ (NOT ‘CONTROL ENTER’…JUST ‘ENTER’) TO TRIGGER THE APP. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? TELL ME WHAT YOU TINK I WANT. TEHRE IS AN IMPORTANT CATCH: EVEN THOUGH THE ‘CHAT WITH AI’ FUNCTION HAS ALL OF THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED FUNCTIONALITY, IT OTHEWRISE ACTS JUST LIKE AN LLM; IT HAS CONTINUITY; IT ’REMEMBERS’ PREVIOUS STATEMENTS FROM THE CHAT; IT DOES NOT TREAT EACH STATEMENT LIKE IT IS BRAND NEW. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
