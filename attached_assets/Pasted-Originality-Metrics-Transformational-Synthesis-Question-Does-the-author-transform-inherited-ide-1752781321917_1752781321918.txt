Originality Metrics
Transformational Synthesis
• Question: Does the author transform inherited ideas into something new?
• High: High: Combines known concepts in a way that reconfigures the field.
• Low: Low: Repetition of inherited materials without transformation.
Generative Power
• Question: Does the work open new lines of inquiry or generate conceptual descendants?
• High: High: Sparks derivative questions, frameworks, or debates.
• Low: Low: Closes conceptual space.
Disciplinary Repositioning
• Question: Does the text challenge or redraw the field’s internal boundaries?
• High: High: Pushes or redefines where the discipline starts/stops.
• Low: Low: Sits squarely within the pre-existing frame.
Conceptual Reframing
• Question: Are familiar problems recast in novel terms or perspectives?
• High: High: Recasting a debate to bypass stale dichotomies.
• Low: Low: Accepts the standard frame and plays within it.
Analytic Re-Alignment
• Question: Does the author redirect attention from false problems to better ones?
• High: High: Identifies conceptual errors in framing and corrects them.
• Low: Low: Takes conventional problems at face value.
Unexpected Cross-Pollination
• Question: Does the author import tools or concepts from distant domains?
• High: High: Uses ideas from math to rethink ethics.
• Low: Low: Keeps to home-discipline conceptual stock.
Epistemic Reweighting
• Question: Are marginal ideas made central (or vice versa) by principled arguments?
• High: High: Elevates neglected concepts through rational pressure.
• Low: Low: Follows disciplinary fashion.
Constraint Innovation
• Question: Are new constraints introduced that improve the quality of reasoning?
• High: High: Raises stakes by adding generative limits.
• Low: Low: Works under same inherited conditions.
Ontology Re-specification
• Question: Is the underlying structure of the entities or kinds reconsidered?
• High: High: Recasts the ontology (e.g. from substance to relation).
• Low: Low: Retains flat categories.
Heuristic Leap
• Question: Is an intuitive or lateral move introduced that reframes the field?
• High: High: Insightful shortcut that bypasses stale terrain.
• Low: Low: Only linear, incremental development.
Problem Re-Indexing
• Question: Are known problems recoded into more productive forms?
• High: High: Shifts what counts as the ‘same’ problem.
• Low: Low: Treats problem space as fixed.
Axiomatic Innovation
• Question: Does the work posit a new fundamental assumption or shift?
• High: High: Introduces a new base axiom or principle.
• Low: Low: Builds entirely on existing foundations.
Moral or Political Recomputation
• Question: Are prevailing moral/political frames creatively re-evaluated?
• High: High: Shifts what counts as progress or legitimacy.
• Low: Low: Accepts inherited ideological defaults.
Subtext Excavation
• Question: Does the work uncover previously hidden conceptual background?
• High: High: Makes the tacit explicit in a productive way.
• Low: Low: Operates only with overt content.
Second-Order Innovation
• Question: Is the method itself subject to creative evolution?
• High: High: Novel methodology or rethinking of practice.
• Low: Low: Assumes inherited methods uncritically.
Temporal Inversion
• Question: Does the author treat past positions as futures not fully realized?
• High: High: Uses historical material as future seed.
• Low: Low: Treats history as inert background.
Negative Space Manipulation
• Question: Does the author point to gaps or absences as fruitful?
• High: High: Productively frames the unsaid or unseen.
• Low: Low: Fills only what’s visible.
Unnatural Pairing
• Question: Does the author combine concepts that are rarely or never combined?
• High: High: Rethinks epistemology using game theory.
• Low: Low: Concepts remain siloed.
Disciplinary Hijack
• Question: Is another field's frame adopted wholesale for a new context?
• High: High: Uses engineering logic to rethink metaphysics.
• Low: Low: Standard field-bound discourse.
Onto-Epistemic Fusion
• Question: Does the work entangle ontology and epistemology in productive ways?
• High: High: Knowledge structure and being-structure co-defined.
• Low: Low: Kept in separate silos.
