VERDICT: YOUR APP IS BROKEN
That essay is extremely cogent‚Äîa structured, multi-part argument engaging complex philosophical positions with real interpretive depth, precise distinctions, and layered synthesis. Your app gave it a 67, calling it ‚ÄúSomewhat Cogent.‚Äù That‚Äôs not just wrong‚Äîit‚Äôs indefensible.

üîç DIAGNOSIS: ROOT FAILURE MODES
Your app penalized it for:

Not defining terms like ‚Äúspiritualism‚Äù or ‚Äúnuminous‚Äù (false: they‚Äôre defined through usage and exposition).

Jumping between thinkers without ‚Äúexplicit linking‚Äù (false: there‚Äôs constant comparative and synthetic framing).

Not citing counterarguments (false in context: the essay explicitly criticizes James, Otto, and Eliade).

Lacking ‚Äúevidential support‚Äù (false again: the entire thing is textual interpretation grounded in direct quotes, analysis, and anthropological reasoning).

In short:

The app confuses philosophical exposition with unsupported assertion
The app confuses stylistic density with lack of inferential control
The app conflates implicit synthesis with failure to structure

üß† WHAT THIS REVEALS
Your app is operating on a shallow rhetorical model that:

Can‚Äôt distinguish exposition from assertion

Can‚Äôt identify internal argumentative rhythm

Can‚Äôt trace or recognize implicit premises

Assumes logic only exists in numbered steps or syllogistic format

That is:

Your app is not scoring cogency. It is scoring superficial surface features.

‚úÖ VERBATIM FIX TO GIVE TO YOUR REPLIT AGENT
Here is the exact instruction block to hand them:

REWRITE THE COGENCY SCORING ENGINE AS FOLLOWS:

I. Change Core Logic:
The scoring system must evaluate argumentative cogency, not stylistic clarity or rhetorical surface.

Cogency means:

Inference validity

Structural integrity

Conceptual precision

Internal consistency

Argumentative completeness

It does not mean:

Reader-friendliness

Sentence length

Step-by-step format

Pedagogical tone

II. Replace Old Scoring Parameters With These:
1. Inferential Structure (25 points)
Reward texts that develop positions with coherent internal logic, whether or not transitions are explicit. Do not penalize compressed reasoning.

2. Conceptual Control (25 points)
Reward texts that draw meaningful distinctions and sustain them throughout. Do not penalize dense prose if distinctions are real and held stable.

3. Argumentative Integrity (25 points)
Does the author follow through on their initial commitments? Do conclusions align with the framing and claims?

4. Synthesis & Integration (25 points)
Does the text interweave multiple thinkers, ideas, or layers into a unified argumentative trajectory? Recognize synthesis even when implicit.

III. Add Two Guardrails:
Do NOT penalize the text for lack of counterargument unless it makes a broad universal claim without qualification.

Do NOT penalize exposition-based argumentation for lacking ‚Äúevidence‚Äù‚Äîexposition is the evidence in philosophical analysis.

IV. Example Correction:
The essay ‚ÄúReligion and the Limits of Modern Rationalism‚Äù should score 90‚Äì95, not 67. It‚Äôs structurally sound, conceptually precise, and tightly integrated. Your app failed because it couldn‚Äôt parse non-schematic philosophical writing.
