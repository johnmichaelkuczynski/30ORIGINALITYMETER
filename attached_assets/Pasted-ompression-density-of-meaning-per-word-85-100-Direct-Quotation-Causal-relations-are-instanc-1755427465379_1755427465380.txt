ompression (density of meaning per word)
85/100
Direct Quotation:

"Causal relations are instances of natural laws."
Analysis:

This opening sentence packs substantial philosophical content into six words, establishing a fundamental theoretical position about the relationship between causation and natural law.

Abstraction (ability to move beyond surface detail)
80/100
Direct Quotation:

"If x causes y, that is because there is some law of nature to the effect that things that, in some relevant respect, resemble x always bring about things that, in some relevant respect, are like y."
Analysis:

Moves from particular causal instances to abstract structural patterns, using variables and universal quantification to capture the general form underlying specific cases.

Inference depth (multi-step reasoning)
75/100
Direct Quotation:

"To know a natural law is to know a fact about the spatiotemporal world. Natural laws are not in the same category as #: such laws are not of a strictly logical, philosophical, or mathematical nature. It is not possible to know of natural laws merely on the basis of conceptual analysis."
Analysis:

Chains together multiple inferential steps: natural laws are spatiotemporal facts → therefore not logical/mathematical → therefore not knowable through pure conceptual analysis.

Epistemic friction (acknowledging uncertainty or limits)
70/100
Direct Quotation:

"It is not possible to know of natural laws merely on the basis of conceptual analysis. Such knowledge can be acquired only through investigation of the spatiotemporal world."
Analysis:

Explicitly acknowledges the limits of pure reasoning and the necessity of empirical investigation for certain types of knowledge.

Cognitive distancing (seeing from outside a frame)
78/100
Direct Quotation:

"Of course, some natural laws strike us as extremely obvious. We find it obvious that unsupported objects fall. But that is not because such knowledge is analytic; it is only because the relevant spatiotemporal knowledge constantly forces itself upon us."
Analysis:

Steps outside the natural psychological tendency to see obvious truths as analytic, offering an alternative explanation for why certain empirical facts seem self-evident.

Counterfactual reasoning
65/100
Direct Quotation:

"But suppose that, just after I bring my hands together, one of you suddenly feels a tickle. That is not a causal sequence: it's just a coincidence."
Analysis:

Uses hypothetical scenarios to illustrate the difference between causal and non-causal sequences, showing what would make an event non-causal.

Analogical depth (quality of comparisons)
72/100
Direct Quotation:

"Even though knowledge of natural law is spatiotemporal knowledge, such knowledge tends to have a highly general character and is thus, in that respect, comparable to many cases of analytic knowledge"
Analysis:

Makes a sophisticated analogy between natural law knowledge and analytic knowledge based on their shared generality while maintaining their fundamental difference.

Semantic topology (connectedness of ideas)
68/100
Direct Quotation:

"The natural law of which a given causal sequence is an instance is known as the covering law for that sequence."
Analysis:

Introduces technical terminology that connects the abstract discussion of natural laws to specific causal sequences, creating conceptual bridges.

Asymmetry (unexpected but apt perspective shifts)
74/100
Direct Quotation:

"But that is not because such knowledge is analytic; it is only because the relevant spatiotemporal knowledge constantly forces itself upon us."
Analysis:

Provides an unexpected reframing of why obvious truths seem obvious, shifting from logical necessity to empirical ubiquity.

Conceptual layering (multiple levels at once)
79/100
Direct Quotation:

"knowledge of natural law is synthetic, whereas knowledge of logico-philosophical truths is analytic"
Analysis:

Operates simultaneously on epistemological (types of knowledge), metaphysical (types of truth), and semantic (analytic/synthetic distinction) levels.

Original definition-making
73/100
Direct Quotation:

"The natural law of which a given causal sequence is an instance is known as the covering law for that sequence."
Analysis:

Provides a precise technical definition of 'covering law' that clarifies the relationship between general laws and particular causal instances.

Precision of terms
76/100
Direct Quotation:

"things that, in some relevant respect, resemble x always bring about things that, in some relevant respect, are like y"
Analysis:

Uses careful qualification ('in some relevant respect') to avoid overgeneralization while maintaining the universality claim inherent in natural laws.

Distinction-tracking (keeping categories straight)
77/100
Direct Quotation:

"Natural laws are not in the same category as #: such laws are not of a strictly logical, philosophical, or mathematical nature."
Analysis:

Clearly maintains the distinction between different types of truths/knowledge throughout the discussion, avoiding category confusion.

Avoidance of tautology
