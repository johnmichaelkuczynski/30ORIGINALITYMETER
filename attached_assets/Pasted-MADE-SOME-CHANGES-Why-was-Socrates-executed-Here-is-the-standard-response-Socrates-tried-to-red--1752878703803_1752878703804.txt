MADE SOME CHANGES Why was Socrates executed? Here is the standard response. 
“Socrates tried to red pill his fellow Athenians. They didn’t want to be red pilled. So they executed him.”
That is not the reason. It is the opposite of the real reason. The real reason is the reason his executioners gave. The real reason is that Socrates tried to blue pill his fellow Athenians with confusing and irrelevant sophistries; and rather than waste time and effort trying to combat those sophistries on their own terms, they executed him.
During the period in question, Athens was involved in a bitter civil war. In the context of a war, especially when the war in question is a civil war, all confusing discussions relating to politics must be assumed to be what the Soviets referred to as ‘agit-prop’---propaganda designed to confuse and agitate. Socrates caused Athenians to question their pre-existing moral beliefs, which undermined their patriotism at a time when Athens most needed it. It may well be that Socrates’ criticisms of those beliefs were valid. But Socrates, so it appears, was not on trial for speaking falsely but for being disruptive; and he very much seems to have been guilty of that charge, with the consequence that he weakened political resolve precisely when it was most needed.
Obviously, truth is in general to be preferred to fiction. But truths taken out of context, or made available to people who don’t know how to put them into context, can be as damaging as falsehoods and are likely to lead to
 
confusion, which in turn is likely to lead to acceptance of falsehoods.
As a philosopher, Socrates was obviously head and shoulders above his peers, but the day-to-day functioning of a society requires that some positions be uncritically accepted; and Socrates appears to have targeted those acceptances, with disastrous consequences for Athens, this being the real reason that he was executed.



The Meaning of Plato’s Cave Allegory
There are two ways to understand the Allegory of the Cave. On the one hand, it can be seen as putting forth a hypothesis concerning the structure of reality. On the other hand, it can be interpreted as an attempt to ‘red pill’ people about the structure of society.
Taken the first way, the Allegory of the Cave is saying that, although our senses give us raw data, intellect is needed to model this data appropriately and therefore to see the true structure of reality. Thus taken, this allegory has no political or social overtones and is merely a point about how the world is structured (it consist of visible phenomena governed by underlying and therefore invisible laws), along with an epistemological corollary (in order to understand the world, it is not enough to observe it: we must also interpret those observations, and the intellect is therefore at least as much a source of knowledge as our senses).
Taken the second way, this allegory seems to be saying that members of society live propaganda-based lies. In this particular context, Plato does not tell us much about the nature of those lies. Indeed, it is not entirely clear that he is in fact discussing society. But his repeated use of terms like ‘prisoner’, ‘shackles’, and ‘blinded’ suggests as much. Other passages in the Republic make it clear that Plato was deeply distrustful of every stratum of society. He distrusted non-rulers, thinking them little more than animals; and he also distrusted rulers, mainly because, it seems, he himself was one and therefore knew firsthand how untrustworthy they could be.
 
A One Page Proof of Plato’s Theory of Forms
Anything that exists in space-time is but an instance of something that does not so exist. This is the essence of Plato’s Theory of Forms. Consider some spherical object---a ball of some kind. (For expository reasons, suppose this object to be perfectly spherical.) This object, being spherical, is an 'instance' of the property--or, as Plato would say, the 'form'--of sphericity. Of course, this object is also an instance of innumerably many other properties (or 'forms'). Supposing that its mass is n, it is an instance of the property of having mass n; and supposing that its molecular structure is xyz, it is an instance of the property of having molecular structure xyz.
Plato's theory of forms is correct. The supposition that properties exist is necessary to validate even the most rudimentary inferences. Consider the inference from 'John and Bill are both tall’ to ‘there is something that John and Bill have in common.’ This inference obviously goes through, and it presupposes the existence of a property (namely, tallness), since the term ‘something’ in the second statement is obviously shorthand for ‘some property.’
Attempts have been made to replace statements about properties with statements about their instances, but such attempts inevitably fail. The statement 'one can have most of the properties of a great businessman without being a great businessman' cannot be translated into a statement that does not presuppose the existence of properties.
As for the idea that properties are identical with or composed of their instances, that too is a non-starter. For example, some have tried to identify the property of being a rock with a 'scattered object' consisting of all rocks. But this move fails, since even though that 'scattered object' is always undergoing changes (in, for example, the the location of its outer boundary), the property of being a rock does not undergo corresponding changes, which would not be possible if that property were identical with that object.
Analogous reasoning refutes any attempt to identify any property with any spatiotemporal entity.
Plato himself mischaracterized his own theory, by assuming that properties must in some way or other 'resemble' their own instances. And, of
 
course, if it is assumed that instances of properties must resemble property- instances, then various paradoxes will arise, including the Paradoxes discussed by Plato himself in his dialogue the Parmenides. But the very essence of Plato's theory is that properties, being non-spatiotemporal, do not relate to their instances in the way in which spatiotemporal entities relate to other spatiotemporal entities: they do not resemble them, they are not composed of them, and they do not causally interact.
To say that properties exist is simply to say that there are 'ways' things can be: being round is a way that a thing can be, and so is being green or red or male or female. Ways things can be are not spatiotemporal. A way that something can be is simply a possibility as to how it can be, and such a possibility obviously isn’t a constituent of space-time, even if the object in question is. So Plato's Theory of Forms is a demonstrably correct one.
Indeed, it is as much a truism as the assertion that a possibility as to how something can be is not a spatiotemporal entity.
