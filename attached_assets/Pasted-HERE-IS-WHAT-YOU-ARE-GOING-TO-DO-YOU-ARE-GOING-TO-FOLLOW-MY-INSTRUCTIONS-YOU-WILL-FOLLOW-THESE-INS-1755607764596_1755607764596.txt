HERE IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO: YOU ARE GOING TO FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS; YOU WILL FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH MODE, FOR EACH LLM. PERIOD. THEN YOU WILL TEST EACH LLM SINGLE DOCUMENT MODE (EACH MODE INTELLIGENCE ETC) BY EVALUATING THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENT: IF ANY ONE GIVES IT LESS THAN 95/100 EVER UNDER ANY CRICUMSTANCES FOR ANY QUESTION., THEN UYOU FAILED. THEN TO TEST THE TWO DOCUMENT MODE, YOU WILL EVALUATE THAT SAME DOCUMENT AND COMPARE IT   THE FOLLOWING TO DISSERTATION ABSTRACT (ABOUT MCDOWELL): In this dissertation, I critically examine the philosophy of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism is, among other things, a philosophy of mental content. It attempts to dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental content by splitting the difference between two diametrically opposed accounts of content. John McDowell's minimal empiricism and Richard Gaskin's minimalist empiricism are two versions of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism itself originates with McDowell's work. This dissertation is divided into five parts. First, in the Introduction, I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined. Second, I offer a detailed description of McDowell’s minimal empiricism. Third, I critique Gaskin's critique and modification of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that (1) Gaskin's critiques are faulty and that (2) Gaskin's minimalist empiricism is very dubious. Fourth, I scrutinize the alleged credentials of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that McDowell's version of linguistic idealism is problematic. I then comment on a recent dialogue between transcendental empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology. The dialogue culminates with Dreyfus's accusation of the “Myth of the Mental.” I argue that this accusation is correct in which case McDowell's direct realism is problematic. I conclude that minimal empiricism does not dissolve the dilemma of mental content. Finally, I argue that Tyler Burge successfully undermines the doctrine of disjunctivism, but disjunctivism is crucial for transcendental empiricism. Ultimately, however, I aim to show that transcendental empiricism is an attractive alternative to philosophies of mental content.
