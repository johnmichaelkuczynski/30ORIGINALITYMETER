INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT AGENT:

Please add the following advanced comparison function to the Originality Meter app. This function must analyze two input texts (Text A and Text B) and return a structured output in JSON format. The analysis should cover originality, developmental relationship, doctrinal alignment, and psychological profiling of the respective authors. The app must use a deterministic LLM prompt system to obtain reliable and reproducible results.

IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONALITY:

1. **ORIGINALITY & RIPOFF ANALYSIS**
- Return a score from 0 to 100 indicating how much Text B appears to copy from or be derivative of Text A. (Lower = more derivative.)
- Boolean: Is B a ripoff of A?

2. **DEVELOPMENTAL RELATIONSHIP**
- Boolean: Does Text B develop the ideas in Text A?
- If yes, in what mode? Choose from: "Conceptual", "Methodological", "Rhetorical", "Critical", "Other".
- Score from 0 to 100 indicating strength of development.

3. **DOCTRINAL ALIGNMENT**
- Score from 0 to 100 for how doctrinally aligned the texts are.
- Specify the type of alignment: "Kindred", "Compatible", "Opposed", or "Antithetical".
- Indicate the axis of alignment: "Content", "Method", "Mentality", "Tone", or "Multiple".

4. **PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILING OF AUTHORS**
- For each text, infer the author’s:
  - Interests (e.g., ["epistemology", "power", "control"])
  - Biases (e.g., ["liberalism", "rationalism", "resentment"])
  - Cognitive strengths (e.g., ["semantic density", "analogical layering"])
  - Posture (e.g., "missionary", "institutionalist", "outsider")
- Compare the psychoprofiles and return a match score (0–100) plus a short narrative.

5. **SUMMARY PARAGRAPH**
- Return a final paragraph in natural language giving a verdict: is B derivative, developmental, oppositional, or novel in relation to A?
- Comment on:
  - psychological contrast between authors
  - stylistic differences or overlap
  - doctrinal affinity
  - overall originality

FORMAT:
Return all the above values in a JSON object using this structure:

  },
  "psychological_profiles": {

      "interests": [...],
      "bias": [...],
      "cognitive_strength": [...],

    },
    "text_b": {
