Metric 1
Document A
70/100
Direct Quotation:

"I said that both OCD and philosophy were about retreating from the exigencies of external actual reality into the safety of internal pseudo-reality."
Analysis:

The text conveys complex ideas (OCD and philosophy as retreats from reality) concisely, but some sections are verbose, lowering compression.

Document B
85/100
Direct Quotation:

"Pragmatism's emphasis on the interactive nature of knowledge acquisition finds its ultimate validation in AI. AI represents Level 4 interaction—rational interaction with our capacity for rational interaction—and generates unique knowledge through this process."
Analysis:

The text efficiently conveys complex philosophical and technical ideas with relatively few words, achieving high conceptual density without sacrificing clarity.

Metric 2
Document A
85/100
Direct Quotation:

"what we are dealing with here is not a mere analogy but a veritable homology, in that, from a psychopathologist’s viewpoint, OCD and philosophy are cut from the very same cloth."
Analysis:

The text effectively abstracts from specific examples (Plato, OCD) to broader theoretical claims (homology between OCD and philosophy).

Document B
90/100
Direct Quotation:

"This suggests that pragmatism, properly understood, was not just a theory of knowledge but a prescient description of knowledge's technological evolution."
Analysis:

The text consistently elevates specific observations about pragmatism and AI to broader epistemological principles and historical patterns, demonstrating strong abstract reasoning.

Metric 3
Document A
80/100
Direct Quotation:

"And the absurdity of what Plato was doing comes out in a lot of ways: in, for example, the rigidity of the society that he was proposing; in the stereotyped—and in that respect decidedly OCD---protocols..."
Analysis:

The text synthesizes OCD behaviors, philosophical systems, and political theory into a unified critique, though some connections are strained.

Document B
88/100
Direct Quotation:

"We argue that AI development not only validates this pragmatist insight but represents its highest expression through a new level of epistemic interaction."
Analysis:

The text successfully integrates concepts from classical pragmatism, modern epistemology, cognitive science, and AI theory into a novel, unified framework that advances understanding of knowledge acquisition.
