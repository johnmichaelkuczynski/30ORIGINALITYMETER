Please extend the current two-text comparison module of the Originality Meter app using the following logic. Preserve all existing functionality, but add the requested enhancements below. The final system should generate a multi-dimensional comparison report, with a simplified score output and detailed interpretive section.

1. Preprocess Both Texts:
Normalize case (lowercase standardization)

Strip extraneous punctuation but preserve syntactic markers

Sentence-split and paragraph-split each text

Extract semantic units:

Core propositions

Key vocabulary

Argumentative skeleton (claim, premise, support pattern)

2. Run Comparisons Along These Vectors (Score 0–10 per vector):
a. Content Similarity:
Lexical overlap (Jaccard or cosine similarity on TF-IDF or embedding vectors)

Conceptual paraphrase overlap (use sentence embedding similarity + paraphrase recognition)

Argument structure matching (claim/premise/inference alignment)

b. Stylistic Similarity:
Sentence rhythm, syntax tree depth, word-length averages

Rhetorical device patterning (metaphor, analogy, parallelism)

Tone/register (academic, conversational, polemical, etc.)

c. Epistemic Profile Similarity:
Degree of compression (info density per sentence)

Abstraction level (concreteness vs generality)

Inferential chain length and complexity

Friction level (epistemic risk, resistance, tension)

d. Narrative & Topical Similarity:
Subject-matter overlap

Illustrative structure (parallel use of examples/analogies)

Shared reference points (e.g., authors, traditions, frameworks)

3. Rip-Off Risk Score (0–100):
Weighted average of content + epistemic similarity, with stylistic factors as secondary. Return score with interpretive label:

0–30: Unrelated

31–60: Possibly derivative

61–85: Highly derivative

86–100: Likely rip-off

Also include:

3–5 sentence explanation of result

Highlighted matching sections (optional layer)

4. Development / Derivation Function:
Add a function that assesses whether Text B substantively develops the ideas of Text A (or vice versa):

Is B a faithful elaboration of A’s conceptual framework?

Does B extend or reinterpret A's ideas in a non-derivative way?

Score on a 0–10 development scale:

0: No continuity

5: Shared framework, but no development

10: Full conceptual maturation of earlier ideas

Output this score and include a few sentences describing how the development manifests (if at all).

5. Doctrinal Affinity / Opposition Detection:
Add a module that compares both texts for:

Content agreement vs tension

Methodological similarity (empiricism, rationalism, phenomenology, etc.)

General mentality (diagnostic vs celebratory, pragmatic vs idealistic, etc.)

Return a categorical classification:

Doctrinally kindred

Methodologically kindred

Doctrinally opposed

Methodologically opposed

Ambiguous / Neutral

Justify classification in 2–3 sentences.

6. Author Psychology Inference Module:
For each text, generate a speculative psychological profile of the author based on stylistic, epistemic, and thematic features. Include:

Primary intellectual interests (e.g., ontology, systems, aesthetics, etc.)

Intellectual strengths (e.g., abstraction, synthesis, criticality)

Cognitive weaknesses (e.g., verbosity, vagueness, shallowness)

Emotional or motivational signatures (e.g., idealism, resentment, evangelism, detachment)

Possible personal agenda or “axe to grind”

Then produce a comparative profile:

Shared traits

Conflicting traits

Likely authorial stance toward one another (respectful? dismissive? antagonistic?)

This section should be speculative, but insightful—based solely on textual signals.

7. Final Output
Return the following:

Overall Similarity Score (0–100)

Rip-Off Risk classification

Development Relationship Score (0–10) and paragraph summary

Doctrinal Affinity classification and paragraph summary

Author Psychological Profiles (Text A and Text B)

Comparative Psychological Summary

Optional: inline highlights of matching structures or overlapping claims
