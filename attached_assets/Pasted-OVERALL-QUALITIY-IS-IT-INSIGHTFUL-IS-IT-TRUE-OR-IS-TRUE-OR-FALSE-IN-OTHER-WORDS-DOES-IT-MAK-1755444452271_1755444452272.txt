OVERALL QUALITIY
IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
IS IT TRUE? 
OR IS TRUE OR FALSE? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES IT MAKE AN ADJUDICABLE CLAIM? (CLAIMS TO THE EFFECT THAT SO AND SO MIGHT HAVE SAID SUCH AND SUCH DO NOT COUNT.)
DOES IT MAKE A CLAIM ABOUT HOW SOME ISSUE IS TO BE RESOLVE OR ONLY ABOUT HOW SOME 'AUTHORITY' MIGHT FEEL ABOUT SOME ASPECT OF THAT ISSUE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? 
IS IT FRESH? 
IS IT THE PRODUCT OF INSIGHT? OR OF SOMEBODY RECYCLING OLD MATERIAL OR JUST RECYLING SLOGANS/MEMES AND/OR NAME-DROPPING?
IS IT BORING? IE SETTING ASIDE PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO IMPAIRED TO UNDERSTAND IT AND THEREFORE FIND IT BORING, IT IS BORING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SMART ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND IT?
DOES IT PRESENT A FRESH NEW ANGLE? IF NOT, DOES IT PROVIDE A FRESH NEW WAY OF DEFENDING OR EVALUATING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A NOT-SO-FRESH POINT?
WOULD AN INTELLIGENT PERSON WHO WAS NOT UNDER PRESSURE (FROM A PROFESSOR OR COLLEAGUE OR BOSS OF PUBLIC OPINION) LIKELY FIND IT TO BE USEFUL AS AN EPISTEMIC INSTRUMENT (MEANS OF ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE)?
IF THE POINT IT DEFENDS IS NOT TECHNICALLY TRUE, IS THAT POINT AT LEAST OPERATIONALLY TRUE (USEFUL TO REGARD AS TRUE IN SOME CONTEXTS)? 
DOES THE PASSAGE GENERATE ORGANICALLY? DO IDEAS DEVELOP? OR IS IT JUST A SERIES OF FORCED STATEMENTS THAT ARE ONLY FORMALLY OR ARTIFICIALLY RELATED TO PREVIOUS STATEMENTS?
IS THERE A STRONG OVER-ARCHING IDEA? DOES THIS IDEA GOVERN THE REASONING? OR IS THE REASONING PURELY SEQUENTIAL, EACH STATEMENT BEING A RESPONSE TO THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING ONE WITHOUT 
ALSO IN SOME WAY SUBSTANTIATING THE MAIN ONE?
IF ORIGINAL, IS IT ORIGINAL BY VIRTUE OF BEING INSIGHTFUL OR BY VIRTUE OF BEING DEFECTIVE OR FACETIOUS?
IF THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF SPONTANEITY, ARE THEY INTERNAL TO A LARGER, WELL-BEHAVED LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE? 
IS THE AUTHOR ABLE TO 'RIFF' (IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS, RATHER THAN UNDERMINING, THE MAIN POINT AND ARGUMENTATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE PASSAGE)? OR IS IT
WOODEN AND BUREAUCRATIC? 
IS IT ACTUALLY SMART OR IS IT 'GEEK'-SMART (SMART IN THE WAY THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT PARTICULARLY SMART BUT WHO WAS ALWAYS LAST TO BE PICKED BY THE SOFTBALL TEAM 
BECOMES SMART)? 
IS IT MR. SPOCKS SMART (ACTUALLY SMART) OR Lieutenant DATA SMART (WHAT A DUMB PERSON WOULD REGARD AS SMART)? 
IS IT "SMART" IN THE SENSE THAT, FOR CULTURAL OR SOCIAL REASONS, WE WOULD PRESUME THAT ONLY A SMART PERSON WOULD DISCUSS SUCH MATTERS? OR IS IT INDEED--SMART? 
IS IT SMART BY VIRTUE BEING ARGUMENTATIVE AND SNIPPY OR BY VIRTUE OF BEING ILLUMINATING?
