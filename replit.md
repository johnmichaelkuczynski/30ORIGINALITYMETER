# Originality Meter - Semantic Analysis Application

## Overview

The Originality Meter is a web application designed to evaluate the intellectual originality and quality of written content. It analyzes passages for conceptual innovation, semantic distance from existing ideas, and overall intellectual merit. The system supports single-passage and comparative analysis, document processing, graph generation, and AI-powered content evaluation. Its vision is to provide a sophisticated tool for assessing the depth and novelty of ideas across various disciplines.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes

### January 17, 2025
- ✅ Fixed 160-metric analysis system - now fully functional
- ✅ Changed waiting message from "15-30 seconds" to "1-2 minutes" 
- ✅ Resolved frontend display issues preventing results from showing
- ✅ Updated UI to correctly show "40 parameters" instead of "20 parameters"
- ✅ Analysis system now provides direct quotations + explanations for each metric
- ✅ Anthropic set as default LLM provider for all analysis functions
- ✅ Backend analysis confirmed working with structured JSON responses (numbered keys 0-39)
- ✅ Frontend successfully displays analysis results with proper formatting
- ✅ **DUAL ANALYSIS COMPLETELY FIXED** - Both intelligence and originality dual analysis working
- ✅ Enhanced JSON parsing with robust markdown code block extraction and fallback methods
- ✅ Frontend now properly handles both single and dual document analysis formats
- ✅ Color-coded comparative display (blue for Document A, green for Document B)
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved, full system operational
- ✅ **NEW FEATURE: Generate Perfect Example** - Users can now generate 95-99/100 example text on same topic
- ✅ Added "Generate Perfect Example (100/100)" button to single passage analysis results
- ✅ Perfect example generation uses Anthropic Claude to create high-quality writing demonstrating all 160 metrics
- ✅ Feature designed to reveal what the evaluation system considers "perfect" intellectual writing
- ✅ **CRITICAL SYSTEM OVERHAUL: Pure Passthrough Analysis** - Removed ALL scoring logic and hardcoded biases
- ✅ LLM now makes all scoring decisions with zero programmatic interference
- ✅ Only scoring instruction: N/100 means 100-N people out of 100 are better (population percentile)
- ✅ Fixed app crashes caused by syntax errors in routes.ts and utils.ts
- ✅ System now operates as true pure passthrough for authentic LLM scoring judgments
