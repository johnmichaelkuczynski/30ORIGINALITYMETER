# Originality Meter - Semantic Analysis Application

## Overview

The Originality Meter is a web application designed to evaluate the intellectual originality and quality of written content. It analyzes passages for conceptual innovation, semantic distance from existing ideas, and overall intellectual merit. The system supports single-passage and comparative analysis, document processing, graph generation, and AI-powered content evaluation. Its vision is to provide a sophisticated tool for assessing the depth and novelty of ideas across various disciplines.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Preferred AI provider: DeepSeek (set as default, confirmed working January 18, 2025).
